 



Fonts are used in this document to convey information. 



*name* 



Denotes a formal term whose meaning is defined in the Glossary. When this font is used, the Glossary definition takes precedence over normal English usage. 



Sometimes a glossary term appears subscripted, as in “*whitespace*<sub>2</sub>.” Such a notation selects one particular Glossary definition out of several, in this case the second. The subscript notation for Glossary terms is generally used where the context might be insufficient to disambiguate among the available definitions. 



*name* 



Denotes the introduction of a formal term locally to the current text. There is still a corresponding glossary entry, and is formally equivalent to a use of “*name*,” but the hope is that making such uses conspicuous will save the reader a trip to the glossary in some cases. 



**name** 



Denotes a symbol in the COMMON-LISP *package*. For information about *case* conventions, see Section 1.4.1.4.1 (Case in Symbols). 



name 



Denotes a sample *name* or piece of *code* that a programmer might write in Common Lisp. 



This font is also used for certain *standardized* names that are not names of *external symbols* of the COMMON-LISP *package*, such as *keywords*<sub>1</sub>, *package names*, and *loop keywords*. 



*name* 



Denotes the name of a *parameter* or *value*. 



In some situations the notation “⟨name⟩” (*i.e.*, the same font, but with surrounding “angle brackets”) is used instead in order to provide better visual separation from surrounding characters. These “angle brackets” are metasyntactic, and never actually appear in program input or output.
