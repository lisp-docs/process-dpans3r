**1.4.1.4.3 Use of the Dot Character** 

The dot appearing by itself in an *expression* such as 

(*item1 item2* . *tail*) 

means that *tail* represents a *list* of *objects* at the end of a list. For example, 

(A B C . (D E F)) 

is notationally equivalent to: 

(A B C D E F) 

Although *dot* is a valid constituent character in a symbol, no *standardized symbols* contain the character *dot*, so a period that follows a reference to a *symbol* at the end of a sentence in this document should always be interpreted as a period and never as part of the *symbol*’s *name*. For example, within this document, a sentence such as “This sample sentence refers to the symbol **car**.” refers to a symbol whose name is "CAR" (with three letters), and never to a four-letter symbol "CAR."
