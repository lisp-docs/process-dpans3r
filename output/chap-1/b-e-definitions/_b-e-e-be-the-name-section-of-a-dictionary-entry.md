 



This section introduces the dictionary entry. It is not explicitly labeled. It appears preceded and followed by a horizontal bar. 



In large print at left, the *defined name* appears; if more than one *defined name* is to be described by the entry, all such *names* are shown separated by commas. 



In somewhat smaller italic print at right is an indication of what kind of dictionary entry this is. Possible values are: 



*Accessor* 



This is an *accessor function*. 



*Class* 



This is a *class*. 











*Condition Type* 



This is a *subtype* of *type* **condition**. 



*Constant Variable* 



This is a *constant variable*. 



*Declaration* 



This is a *declaration identifier* . 



*Function* 



This is a *function*. 



*Local Function* 



This is a *function* that is defined only lexically within the scope of some other *macro form*. 



*Local Macro* 



This is a *macro* that is defined only lexically within the scope of some other *macro form*.

*Symbol* 



This is a *symbol* that is specially recognized in some particular situation, such as the syntax of a *macro*. 



*System Class* 



This is like *class*, but it identifies a *class* that is potentially a *built-in class*. (No *class* is actually required to be a *built-in class*.)  







*Type* 



This is an *atomic type specifier* , and depending on information for each particular entry, may subject to form other *type specifiers*. 



*Type Specifier* 



This is a *defined name* that is not an *atomic type specifier* , but that can be used in constructing valid *type specifiers*. 



*Variable* 



This is a *dynamic variable*.
