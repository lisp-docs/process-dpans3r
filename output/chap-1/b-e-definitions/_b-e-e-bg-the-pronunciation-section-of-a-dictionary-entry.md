**1.4.4.16 The “Pronunciation” Section of a Dictionary Entry** 

This offers a suggested pronunciation for *defined names* so that people not in verbal communication with the original designers can figure out how to pronounce words that are not in normal English usage. This information is advisory only, and is not considered part of the standard. For brevity, it is only provided for entries with names that are specific to Common Lisp and would not be found in *Webster’s Third New International Dictionary the English Language, Unabridged*.
