**1.4.4.20.2 Naming Conventions for Rest Parameters** 

Within this specification, if the name of a *rest parameter* is chosen to be a plural noun, use of that name in *parameter* font refers to the *list* to which the *rest parameter* is bound. Use of the singular form of that name in *parameter* font refers to an *element* of that *list*. 

For example, given a syntax description such as: 

**F** &rest *arguments* 

it is appropriate to refer either to the *rest parameter* named *arguments* by name, or to one of its elements by speaking of “an *argument*,” “some *argument*,” “each *argument*” *etc.*
