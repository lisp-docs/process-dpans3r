**1.4.4.20.4 Return values in the “Syntax” Section** 

An evaluation arrow “*→*” precedes a list of *values* to be returned. For example: 

**F** *a b c → x* 

indicates that F is an operator that has three *required parameters* (*i.e.*, *a*, *b*, and *c*) and that returns one *value* (*i.e.*, *x*). If more than one *value* is returned by an operator, the *names* of the *values* are separated by commas, as in: 

**F** *a b c → x, y, z*
