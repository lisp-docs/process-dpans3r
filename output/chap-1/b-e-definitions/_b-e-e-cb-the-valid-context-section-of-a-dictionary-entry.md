 



This information is used by dictionary entries such as “Declarations” in order to restrict the context in which the declaration may appear. 



A given “Declaration” might appear in a *declaration* (*i.e.*, a **declare** *expression*), a *proclamation* (*i.e.*, a **declaim** or **proclaim** *form*), or both.
