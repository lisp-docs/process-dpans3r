**1.4.4.6.1 The “Compound Type Specifier Kind” Section of a Dictionary Entry** 

An “abbreviating” *type specifier* is one that describes a *subtype* for which it is in principle possible to enumerate the *elements*, but for which in practice it is impractical to do so. 

A “specializing” *type specifier* is one that describes a *subtype* by restricting the *type* of one or more components of the *type*, such as *element type* or *complex part type*. 

A “predicating” *type specifier* is one that describes a *subtype* containing only those *objects* that satisfy a given *predicate*. 

A “combining” *type specifier* is one that describes a *subtype* in a compositional way, using combining operations (such as “and,” “or,” and “not”) on other *types*.
