 

The dictionary entry for each *defined name* is partitioned into sections. Except as explicitly indicated otherwise below, each section is introduced by a label identifying that section. The omission of a section implies that the section is either not applicable, or would provide no interesting information. 

This section defines the significance of each potential section in a dictionary entry.
