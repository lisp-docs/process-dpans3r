 



A *conforming implementation* shall be accompanied by a document that provides a definition of all *implementation-defined* aspects of the language defined by this specification. 



In addition, a *conforming implementation* is encouraged (but not required) to document items in this standard that are identified as *implementation-dependent*, although in some cases such documentation might simply identify the item as “undefined.”
