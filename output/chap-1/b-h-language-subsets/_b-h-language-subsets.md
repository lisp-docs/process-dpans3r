 



The language described in this standard contains no subsets, though subsets are not forbidden. 



For a language to be considered a subset, it must have the property that any valid *program* in that language has equivalent semantics and will run directly (with no extralingual pre-processing, and no special compatibility packages) in any *conforming implementation* of the full language. 



A language that conforms to this requirement shall be described as being a “subset of Common Lisp as specified by ANSI ⟨standard number ⟩.”
