**1.8.4 Deprecated Reader Syntax** 

The #S *reader macro* forces keyword names into the KEYWORD *package*; see Section 2.4.8.13 (Sharpsign S). This feature is deprecated; in the future, keyword names will be taken in the package they are read in, so *symbols* that are actually in the KEYWORD *package* should be used if that is what is desired.
