**11.1.1.1 Package Names and Nicknames** 

Each *package* has a *name* (a *string*) and perhaps some *nicknames* (also *strings*). These are assigned when the *package* is created and can be changed later. 

There is a single namespace for *packages*. The *function* **find-package** translates a package *name* or *nickname* into the associated *package*. The *function* **package-name** returns the *name* of a *package*. The *function* **package-nicknames** returns a *list* of all *nicknames* for a *package*. **rename-package** 

removes a *package*â€™s current *name* and *nicknames* and replaces them with new ones specified by the caller.
