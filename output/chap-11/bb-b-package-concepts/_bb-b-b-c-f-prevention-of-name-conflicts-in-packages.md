 

Within one *package*, any particular name can refer to at most one *symbol*. A name conflict is said to occur when there would be more than one candidate *symbol*. Any time a name conflict is about to occur, a *correctable error* is signaled. 

The following rules apply to name conflicts: 

– Name conflicts are detected when they become possible, that is, when the package structure is altered. Name conflicts are not checked during every name lookup. 

– If the *same symbol* is *accessible* to a *package* through more than one path, there is no name conflict. A *symbol* cannot conflict with itself. Name conflicts occur only between *distinct symbols* with the same name (under **string=**). 

– Every *package* has a list of shadowing *symbols*. A shadowing *symbol* takes precedence over any other *symbol* of the same name that would otherwise be *accessible* in the *package*. A name conflict involving a shadowing symbol is always resolved in favor of the shadowing *symbol*, without signaling an error (except for one exception involving **import**). See **shadow** and **shadowing-import**. 

– The functions **use-package**, **import**, and **export** check for name conflicts. 

– **shadow** and **shadowing-import** never signal a name-conflict error. 

– **unuse-package** and **unexport** do not need to do any name-conflict checking. **unintern** does name-conflict checking only when a *symbol* being *uninterned* is a *shadowing symbol*. 

– Giving a shadowing symbol to **unintern** can uncover a name conflict that had previously been resolved by the shadowing. 

– Package functions signal name-conflict errors of *type* **package-error** before making any change to the package structure. When multiple changes are to be made, it is permissible for the implementation to process each change separately. For example, when **export** is 



 

 

given a *list* of *symbols*, aborting from a name conflict caused by the second *symbol* in the *list* might still export the first *symbol* in the *list*. However, a name-conflict error caused by **export** of a single *symbol* will be signaled before that *symbol*’s *accessibility* in any *package* is changed. 

– Continuing from a name-conflict error must offer the user a chance to resolve the name conflict in favor of either of the candidates. The *package* structure should be altered to reflect the resolution of the name conflict, via **shadowing-import**, **unintern**, or **unexport**. 

– A name conflict in **use-package** between a *symbol present* in the using *package* and an *external symbol* of the used *package* is resolved in favor of the first *symbol* by making it a shadowing *symbol*, or in favor of the second *symbol* by uninterning the first *symbol* from the using *package*. 

– A name conflict in **export** or **unintern** due to a *package*’s inheriting two *distinct symbols* with the *same name* (under **string=**) from two other *packages* can be resolved in favor of either *symbol* by importing it into the using *package* and making it a *shadowing symbol*, just as with **use-package**.
