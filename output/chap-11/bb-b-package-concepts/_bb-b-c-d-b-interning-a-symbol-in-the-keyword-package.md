**11.1.2.3.1 Interning a Symbol in the KEYWORD Package** 

The KEYWORD *package* is treated differently than other *packages* in that special actions are taken when a *symbol* is *interned* in it. In particular, when a *symbol* is *interned* in the KEYWORD *package*, it is automatically made to be an *external symbol* and is automatically made to be a *constant variable* with itself as a *value*.
