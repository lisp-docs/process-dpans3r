 



It is generally best to confine the use of *keywords* to situations in which there are a finitely enumerable set of names to be selected between. For example, if there were two states of a light switch, they might be called :on and :off. 



In situations where the set of names is not finitely enumerable (*i.e.*, where name conflicts might arise) it is frequently best to use *symbols* in some *package* other than KEYWORD so that conflicts will be naturally avoided. For example, it is generally not wise for a *program* to use a *keyword* <sub>1</sub> as a *property indicator* , since if there were ever another *program* that did the same thing, each would clobber the otherâ€™s data.
