**12.1.1.1 Associativity and Commutativity in Numeric Operations** 

For functions that are mathematically associative (and possibly commutative), a *conforming implementation* may process the *arguments* in any manner consistent with associative (and possibly commutative) rearrangement. This does not affect the order in which the *argument* 

*forms* are *evaluated*; for a discussion of evaluation order, see Section 3.1.2.1.2.3 (Function Forms). What is unspecified is only the order in which the *parameter values* are processed. This implies that *implementations* may differ in which automatic *coercions* are applied; see Section 12.1.1.2 (Contagion in Numeric Operations). 

A *conforming program* can control the order of processing explicitly by separating the operations into separate (possibly nested) *function forms*, or by writing explicit calls to *functions* that perform coercions.
