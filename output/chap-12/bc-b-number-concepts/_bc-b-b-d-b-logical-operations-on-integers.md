 



Logical operations require *integers* as arguments; an error of *type* **type-error** should be signaled if an argument is supplied that is not an *integer* . *Integer* arguments to logical operations are treated as if they were represented in two’s-complement notation. 



Figure 12–5 shows *defined names* relating to logical operations on numbers.
