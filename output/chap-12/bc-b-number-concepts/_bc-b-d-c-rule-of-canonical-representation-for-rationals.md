 



If any computation produces a result that is a mathematical ratio of two integers such that the denominator evenly divides the numerator, then the result is converted to the equivalent *integer* . 



If the denominator does not evenly divide the numerator, the canonical representation of a <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"rational"}><i>rational</i></GlossaryTerm> number is as the <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"ratio"}><i>ratio</i></GlossaryTerm> that numerator and that denominator, where the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator is one, and where the denominator is positive and greater than one. 



When used as input (in the default syntax), the notation -0 always denotes the *integer* 0. A *conforming implementation* must not have a representation of “minus zero” for *integers* that is distinct from its representation of zero for *integers*. However, such a distinction is possible for <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"float"}><i>floats</i></GlossaryTerm>; see the <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"type"}><i>type</i></GlossaryTerm> <DictionaryLink styled={true} term={"float"}><b>float</b></DictionaryLink>.
