 

When *rationals* and *floats* are combined by a numerical function, the *rational* is first converted to a *float* of the same format. For *functions* such as **+** that take more than two arguments, it is permitted that part of the operation be carried out exactly using *rationals* and the rest be done using floating-point arithmetic. 

When *rationals* and *floats* are compared by a numerical function, the *function* **rational** is effectively called to convert the *float* to a *rational* and then an exact comparison is performed. In the case of *complex* numbers, the real and imaginary parts are effectively handled individually.
