**Description:**

**Figure 12–14. Mathematical definition of arc sine, arc cosine, and arc tangent** 

These formulae are mathematically correct, assuming completely accurate computation. They are not necessarily the simplest ones for real-valued computations. 

If both *number1* and *number2* are supplied for **atan**, the result is the arc tangent of *number1*/*number2*. The value of **atan** is always between *−π* (exclusive) and *π* (inclusive) when minus zero is not supported. The range of the two-argument arc tangent when minus zero is supported includes *−π*. 

For a *real number1*, the result is a *real* and lies between *−π/*2 and *π/*2 (both exclusive). *number1* can be a *complex* if *number2* is not supplied. If both are supplied, *number2* can be zero provided *number1* is not zero. 

The following definition for arc sine determines the range and branch cuts: 



 

 

**asin, acos, atan** 



arcsin *z* = *−i* log 

&#60;sub&#62;&#60;i&#62;iz&#60;/i&#62; +&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;sup&#62;p&#60;/sup&#62;1 &#60;i&#62;− z&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sup&#62;2&#60;/sup&#62;  

The branch cut for the arc sine function is in two pieces: one along the negative real axis to the left of *−*1 (inclusive), continuous with quadrant II, and one along the positive real axis to the right of 1 (inclusive), continuous with quadrant IV. The range is that strip of the complex plane containing numbers whose real part is between *−π/*2 and *π/*2. A number with real part equal to *−π/*2 is in the range if and only if its imaginary part is non-negative; a number with real part equal to *π/*2 is in the range if and only if its imaginary part is non-positive. 

The following definition for arc cosine determines the range and branch cuts: &#60;sub&#62;arccos &#60;i&#62;z&#60;/i&#62; =&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;i&#62;&#60;sup&#62;π&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;i&#62;−&#60;/i&#62; arcsin &#60;i&#62;z&#60;/i&#62; 

or, which are equivalent, 



arccos *z* = *−i* log 

&#60;sub&#62;&#60;i&#62;z&#60;/i&#62; + &#60;i&#62;i&#60;/i&#62;&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;sup&#62;p&#60;/sup&#62;1 &#60;i&#62;− z&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sup&#62;2&#60;/sup&#62;  

&#60;sub&#62;arccos &#60;i&#62;z&#60;/i&#62; =2 log&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;sup&#62;p&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;sub&#62;(1 + &#60;i&#62;z&#60;/i&#62;)&#60;i&#62;/&#60;/i&#62;2 + &#60;i&#62;i&#60;/i&#62;&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;sup&#62;p&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;sub&#62;(1 &#60;i&#62;− z&#60;/i&#62;)&#60;i&#62;/&#60;/i&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;  

*i* 

The branch cut for the arc cosine function is in two pieces: one along the negative real axis to the left of *−*1 (inclusive), continuous with quadrant II, and one along the positive real axis to the right of 1 (inclusive), continuous with quadrant IV. This is the same branch cut as for arc sine. The range is that strip of the complex plane containing numbers whose real part is between 0 and *π*. A number with real part equal to 0 is in the range if and only if its imaginary part is non-negative; a number with real part equal to *π* is in the range if and only if its imaginary part is non-positive. 

The following definition for (one-argument) arc tangent determines the range and branch cuts: 

arctan &#60;i&#62;z&#60;/i&#62; =&#60;sup&#62;log (1 + &#60;i&#62;iz&#60;/i&#62;) &#60;i&#62;−&#60;/i&#62; log (1 &#60;i&#62;− iz&#60;/i&#62;)&#60;/sup&#62; 

2*i* 

Beware of simplifying this formula; “obvious” simplifications are likely to alter the branch cuts or the values on the branch cuts incorrectly. The branch cut for the arc tangent function is in two pieces: one along the positive imaginary axis above *i* (exclusive), continuous with quadrant 

II, and one along the negative imaginary axis below *−i* (exclusive), continuous with quadrant IV. The points *i* and *−i* are excluded from the domain. The range is that strip of the complex plane containing numbers whose real part is between *−π/*2 and *π/*2. A number with real part equal to *−π/*2 is in the range if and only if its imaginary part is strictly positive; a number with real part equal to *π/*2 is in the range if and only if its imaginary part is strictly negative. Thus the range of 

arc tangent is identical to that of arc sine with the points *−π/*2 and *π/*2 excluded. 

 

 

**asin, acos, atan** 

For **atan**, the signs of *number1* (indicated as *x*) and *number2* (indicated as *y*) are used to derive quadrant information. Figure 12–15 details various special cases. The asterisk (\*) indicates that the entry in the figure applies to implementations that support minus zero.

**Examples:** 

(asin 0) *→* 0.0 

(acos #c(0 1)) *→* #C(1.5707963267948966 -0.8813735870195432) 

(/ (atan 1 (sqrt 3)) 6) *→* 0.087266 

(atan #c(0 2)) *→* #C(-1.5707964 0.54930615) 

**Exceptional Situations:** 

**acos** and **asin** should signal an error of *type* **type-error** if *number* is not a *number* . **atan** should signal **type-error** if one argument is supplied and that argument is not a *number* , or if two arguments are supplied and both of those arguments are not *reals*. 

**acos**, **asin**, and **atan** might signal **arithmetic-error**.

**Notes:** 

The result of either **asin** or **acos** can be a *complex* even if *number* is not a *complex* ; this occurs when the absolute value of *number* is greater than one.
