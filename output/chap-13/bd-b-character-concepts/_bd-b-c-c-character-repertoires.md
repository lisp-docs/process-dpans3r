 



A *repertoire* is a *type specifier* for a *subtype* of *type* **character**. This term is generally used when describing a collection of *characters* independent of their coding. *Characters* in *repertoires* are only identified by name, by *glyph*, or by character description. 



A *repertoire* can contain *characters* from several *scripts*, and a *character* can appear in more than one *repertoire*. 



For some examples of *repertoires*, see the coded character standards ISO 8859/1, ISO 8859/2, and ISO 6937/2. Note, however, that although the term “*repertoire*” is chosen for definitional compatibility with ISO terminology, no *conforming implementation* is required to use *repertoires* standardized by ISO or any other standards organization.
