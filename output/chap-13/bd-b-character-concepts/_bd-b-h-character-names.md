 

The following *character names* must be present in all *conforming implementations*: 

Newline 

The character that represents the division between lines. An implementation must translate between #\Newline, a single-character representation, and whatever external representation(s) may be used. 

Space 

The space or blank character. 

The following names are *semi-standard*; if an *implementation* supports them, they should be used for the described *characters* and no others. 

Rubout 

The rubout or delete character. 

Page 

The form-feed or page-separator character. 

Tab 

The tabulate character. 

Backspace 

The backspace character. 

Return 

The carriage return character. 

Linefeed 

The line-feed character. 

In some *implementations*, one or more of these *character names* might denote a *standard character* ; for example, #\Linefeed and #\Newline might be the *same character* in some *implementations*.
