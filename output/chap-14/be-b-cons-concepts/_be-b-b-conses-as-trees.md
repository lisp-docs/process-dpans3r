 



A *tree* is a binary recursive data structure made up of *conses* and *atoms*: the *conses* are themselves also *trees* (sometimes called “subtrees” or “branches”), and the *atoms* are terminal nodes (sometimes called *leaves*). Typically, the *leaves* represent data while the branches establish some relationship among that data.
