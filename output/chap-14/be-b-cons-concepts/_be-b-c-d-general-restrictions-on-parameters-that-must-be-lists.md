 



Except as explicitly specified otherwise, any *standardized function* that takes a *parameter* that is required to be a *list* should be prepared to signal an error of *type* **type-error** if the *value* received is a *dotted list*. 



Except as explicitly specified otherwise, for any *standardized function* that takes a *parameter* that is required to be a *list*, the consequences are undefined if that *list* is *circular* .
