**15.1.1.2 Array Dimensions** 

An axis of an *array* is called a *dimension*. 

Each *dimension* is a non-negative *fixnum*; if any dimension of an *array* is zero, the *array* has no elements. It is permissible for a *dimension* to be zero, in which case the *array* has no elements, and any attempt to *access* an *element* is an error. However, other properties of the *array*, such as the *dimensions* themselves, may be used.
