 



As a consequence of the behavior for <DictionaryLink styled={true} term={"equal"}><b>equal</b></DictionaryLink>, the rules for visible modification of <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"object"}><i>objects</i></GlossaryTerm> not explicitly mentioned in this section are inherited from those in Section 18.1.2.1 (Visible Modification of Objects with respect to EQ and EQL).
