 



In a *hash table*, any visible change to the count of entries in the *hash table*, to the keys, or to the values associated with the keys is considered a visible modification with regard to **equalp**. 



Note that the visibility of modifications to the keys depends on the equivalence test of the *hash table*, not on the specification of **equalp**.
