**19.1 Overview of Filenames** 

There are many kinds of *file systems*, varying widely both in their superficial syntactic details, and in their underlying power and structure. The facilities provided by Common Lisp for referring to and manipulating *files* has been chosen to be compatible with many kinds of *file systems*, while at the same time minimizing the program-visible differences between kinds of *file systems*. 

Since *file systems* vary in their conventions for naming *files*, there are two distinct ways to represent *filenames*: as *namestrings* and as *pathnames*.
