 



Corresponds to the “version number” concept in many host file systems. 



The version is either a positive *integer* or a *symbol* from the following list: **nil**, :wild, :unspecific, or :newest (refers to the largest version number that already exists in the file system when reading a file, or to a version number greater than any already existing in the file system when writing a new file). Implementations can define other special version *symbols*.
