**19.2.2.1.2.1 Local Case in Pathname Components** 

For the functions in Figure 19–2, a value of :local for the :case argument (the default for these functions) indicates that the functions should receive and yield *strings* in component values as if they were already represented according to the host *file system*’s convention for *case*. 

If the *file system* supports both *cases*, *strings* given or received as *pathname* component values under this protocol are to be used exactly as written. If the file system only supports one *case*, the *strings* will be translated to that *case*.
