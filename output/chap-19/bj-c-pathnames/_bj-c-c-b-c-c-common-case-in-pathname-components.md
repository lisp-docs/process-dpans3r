 

For the functions in Figure 19–2, a value of :common for the :case argument that these *functions* should receive and yield *strings* in component values according to the following conventions: 

*•* All *uppercase* means to use a file system’s customary *case*. 

*•* All *lowercase* means to use the opposite of the customary *case*. 

*•* Mixed *case* represents itself. 

Note that these conventions have been chosen in such a way that translation from :local to :common and back to :local is information-preserving.
