 

If :wild is the value of a *pathname* component, that component is considered to be a wildcard, which matches anything. 

A *conforming program* must be prepared to encounter a value of :wild as the value of any *pathname* component, or as an *element* of a *list* that is the value of the directory component. 

When constructing a *pathname*, a *conforming program* may use :wild as the value of any or all of the directory, name, type, or version component, but must not use :wild as the value of the host, or device component. 

If :wild is used as the value of the directory component in the construction of a *pathname*, the effect is equivalent to specifying the list (:absolute :wild-inferiors), or the same as (:absolute :wild) in a *file system* that does not support :wild-inferiors.
