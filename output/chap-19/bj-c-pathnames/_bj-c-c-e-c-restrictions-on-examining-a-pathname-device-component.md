**19.2.2.4.2 Restrictions on Examining a Pathname Device Component** The device might be a *string*, :wild, :unspecific, or **nil**. 

Note that :wild might result from an attempt to *read* \<sub\>1\</sub\> the *pathname* component, even though portable programs are restricted from *writing*\<sub\>1\</sub\> such a component value; see Section 19.2.2.3 (Restrictions on Wildcard Pathnames) and Section 19.2.2.5 (Restrictions on Constructing Pathnames).
