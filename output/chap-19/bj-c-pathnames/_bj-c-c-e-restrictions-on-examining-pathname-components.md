While the values discussed in the subsections of this section, in Section 19.2.2.2 (Special Pathname Component Values), and in Section 19.2.2.3 (Restrictions on Wildcard Pathnames) apply to values that might be seen when reading the component values, substantially more restrictive rules apply to constructing pathnames; see Section 19.2.2.5 (Restrictions on Constructing Pathnames). 

When examining *pathname* components, *conforming programs* should be aware of the following restrictions.
