 

Although the following examples are possible to execute only in *implementations* which permit :unspecific in the indicated position andwhich permit four-letter type components, they serve to illustrate the basic concept of *pathname* merging. 

(pathname-type 

(merge-pathnames (make-pathname :type "LISP") 

(make-pathname :type "TEXT"))) 

*→* "LISP" 

(pathname-type 

(merge-pathnames (make-pathname :type nil) 

(make-pathname :type "LISP"))) 

*→* "LISP" 

(pathname-type 

(merge-pathnames (make-pathname :type :unspecific) 

(make-pathname :type "LISP"))) 

*→* :UNSPECIFIC
