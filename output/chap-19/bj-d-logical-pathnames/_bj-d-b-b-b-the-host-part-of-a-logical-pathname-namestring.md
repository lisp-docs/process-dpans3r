**19.3.1.1.1 The Host part of a Logical Pathname Namestring** 

The *host* must have been defined as a *logical pathname* host; this can be done by using **setf** of **logical-pathname-translations**. 

The *logical pathname* host name "SYS" is reserved for the implementation. The existence and meaning of SYS: *logical pathnames* is *implementation-defined*.
