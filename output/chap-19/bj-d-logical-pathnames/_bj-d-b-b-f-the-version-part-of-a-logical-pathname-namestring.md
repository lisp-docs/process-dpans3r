 



Some *file systems* do not have *versions*. *Logical pathname* translation to such a *file system* ignores the *version*. This implies that a program cannot rely on being able to store more than one version of a file named by a *logical pathname*. 



If a *wildcard-version* is specified, it parses into :wild.
