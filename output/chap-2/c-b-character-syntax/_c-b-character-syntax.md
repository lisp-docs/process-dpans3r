 



The *Lisp reader* takes <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"character"}><i>characters</i></GlossaryTerm> from a <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"stream"}><i>stream</i></GlossaryTerm>, interprets them as a printed representation of an <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"object"}><i>object</i></GlossaryTerm>, constructs that <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"object"}><i>object</i></GlossaryTerm>, and returns it. 



The syntax described by this chapter is called the *standard syntax*. Operations are provided by Common Lisp so that various aspects of the syntax information represented by a <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"readtable"}><i>readtable</i></GlossaryTerm> can be modified under program control; see Chapter 23 (Reader). Except as explicitly stated otherwise, the syntax used throughout this document is *standard syntax* .
