 

The *Lisp reader* takes *characters* from a *stream*, interprets them as a printed representation of an *object*, constructs that *object*, and returns it. 

The syntax described by this chapter is called the *standard syntax*. Operations are provided by Common Lisp so that various aspects of the syntax information represented by a *readtable* can be modified under program control; see Chapter 23 (Reader). Except as explicitly stated otherwise, the syntax used throughout this document is *standard syntax* .
