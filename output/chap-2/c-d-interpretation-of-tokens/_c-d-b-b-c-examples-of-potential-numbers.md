 



As examples, the *tokens* in Figure 2–10 are *potential numbers*, but they are not actually numbers, and so are reserved *tokens*; a *conforming implementation* is permitted, but not required, to define their meaning.

```
 



The *tokens* in Figure 2–11 are not *potential numbers*; they are always treated as *symbols*: 




```lisp title="Figure 2–11. Examples of symbols"
/ /5 + 1+ 1- foo+ ab.cd <i><sup>∧ ∧</sup></i>/-
```
  







The *tokens* in Figure 2–12 are *potential numbers* if the *current input base* is 16, but they are always treated as *symbols* if the *current input base* is 10.
