 



*Integers* can be written as a sequence of *digits*, optionally preceded by a *sign* and optionally followed by a decimal point; see Figure 2â€“9. When a decimal point is used, the *digits* are taken to be in *radix* 10; when no decimal point is used, the *digits* are taken to be in radix given by the *current input base*. 



For information on how *integers* are printed, see Section 22.1.3.1.1 (Printing Integers).
