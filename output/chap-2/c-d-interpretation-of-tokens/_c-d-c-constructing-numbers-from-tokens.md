 



A *real* is constructed directly from a corresponding numeric *token*; see Figure 2â€“9. 



A *complex* is notated as a #C (or #c) followed by a *list* of two *reals*; see Section 2.4.8.11 (Sharpsign C). 



The *reader macros* #B, #O, #X, and #R may also be useful in controlling the input *radix* in which *rationals* are parsed; see Section 2.4.8.7 (Sharpsign B), Section 2.4.8.8 (Sharpsign O), Section 2.4.8.9 (Sharpsign X), and Section 2.4.8.10 (Sharpsign R). 



This section summarizes the full syntax for *numbers*.
