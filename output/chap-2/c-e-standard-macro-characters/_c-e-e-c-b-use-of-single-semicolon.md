 



Comments that begin with a single <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"semicolon"}><i>semicolon</i></GlossaryTerm> are all aligned to the same column at the right (sometimes called the “comment column”). The text of such a comment generally applies only to the line on which it appears. Occasionally two or three contain a single sentence together; this is sometimes indicated by indenting all but the first with an additional space (after the <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"semicolon"}><i>semicolon</i></GlossaryTerm>).
