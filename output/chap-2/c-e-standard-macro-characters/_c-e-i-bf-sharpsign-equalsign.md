 



#*n*= 



#*n*=*object* reads as whatever *object* has *object* as its printed representation. However, that *object* is labeled by *n*, a required unsigned decimal integer, for possible reference by the syntax #*n*#. The scope of the label is the *expression* being read by the outermost call to **read**; within this *expression*, the same label may not appear twice.
