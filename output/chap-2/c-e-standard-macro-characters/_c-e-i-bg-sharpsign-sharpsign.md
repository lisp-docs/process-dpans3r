#*n*#, where *n* is a required unsigned decimal *integer* , provides a reference to some *object* labeled by #*n*=; that is, #*n*# represents a pointer to the same (**eq**) *object* labeled by #*n*=. For example, a structure created in the variable y by this code: 

(setq x (list ’p ’q)) 

(setq y (list (list ’a ’b) x ’foo x)) 

(rplacd (last y) (cdr y)) 

could be represented in this way: 

((a b) . #1=(#2=(p q) foo #2# . #1#)) 

Without this notation, but with **\*print-length\*** set to 10 and **\*print-circle\*** set to **nil**, the structure would print in this way: 

((a b) (p q) foo (p q) (p q) foo (p q) (p q) foo (p q) ...) 

A reference #*n*# may only occur after a label #*n*=; forward references are not permitted. The reference may not appear as the labeled object itself (that is, #*n*=#*n*#) may not be written because the *object* labeled by #*n*= is not well defined in this case.
