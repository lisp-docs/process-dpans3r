 

#( and ) are used to notate a *simple vector* . 

If an unsigned decimal integer appears between the # and (, it specifies explicitly the length of the *vector* . The consequences are undefined if the number of *objects* specified before the closing ) exceeds the unsigned decimal integer. If the number of *objects* supplied before the closing ) is less than the unsigned decimal integer but greater than zero, the last *object* is used to fill all remaining elements of the *vector* . The consequences are undefined if the unsigned decimal integer is non-zero and number of *objects* supplied before the closing ) is zero. For example, 

#(a b c c c c) 

#6(a b c c c c) 

#6(a b c) 

#6(a b c c)  



all mean the same thing: a *vector* of length 6 with *elements* a, b, and four occurrences of c. Other examples follow: 

#(a b c) ;A vector of length 3 

#(2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47) 

;A vector containing the primes below 50 

#() ;An empty vector 

The notation #() denotes an empty *vector* , as does #0(). 

For information on how the *Lisp printer* prints *vectors*, see Section 22.1.3.4 (Printing Strings), Section 22.1.3.6 (Printing Bit Vectors), or Section 22.1.3.7 (Printing Other Vectors).
