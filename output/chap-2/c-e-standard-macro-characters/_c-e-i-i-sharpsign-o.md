 

#O*rational* reads *rational* in octal (radix 8). For example, 

#o37/15 *≡* 31/13 

#o777 *≡* 511 

#o105 *≡* 69 ;105&#60;sub&#62;8&#60;/sub&#62; 

The consequences are undefined if the token immediately following the #O does not have the syntax of an octal (*i.e.*, radix 8) *rational*.
