**2.4.8.9 Sharpsign X** 

#X*rational* reads *rational* in hexadecimal (radix 16). The digits above 9 are the letters A through F (the lowercase letters a through f are also acceptable). For example, 

#xF00 *≡* 3840 

#x105 *≡* 261 ;105\<sub\>16\</sub\> 

The consequences are undefined if the token immediately following the #X does not have the syntax of a hexadecimal (*i.e.*, radix 16) *rational*.
