 



*Sharpsign* is a *non-terminating dispatching macro character* . It reads an optional sequence of digits and then one more character, and uses that character to select a *function* to run as a *reader macro function*. 



The *standard syntax* includes constructs introduced by the # character. The syntax of these constructs is as follows: a character that identifies the type of construct is followed by arguments in some form. If the character is a letter, its *case* is not important; #O and #o are considered to be equivalent, for example. 



Certain # constructs allow an unsigned decimal number to appear between the # and the character. 



The *reader macros* associated with the *dispatching macro character* # are described later in this section and summarized in Figure 2–19.

**Figure 2–19. Standard # Dispatching Macro Character Syntax** 



The combinations marked by an asterisk (\*) are explicitly reserved to the user. No *conforming implementation* defines them. 



Note also that *digits* do not appear in the preceding table. This is because the notations #0, #1, ..., #9 are reserved for another purpose which occupies the same syntactic space. When a *digit* follows a *sharpsign*, it is not treated as a dispatch character. Instead, an unsigned integer argument is  







accumulated and passed as an *argument* to the *reader macro* for the *character* that follows the digits. For example, #2A((1 2) (3 4)) is a use of #A with an argument of 2.
