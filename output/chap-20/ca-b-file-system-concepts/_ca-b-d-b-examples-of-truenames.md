 



For example, a DEC TOPS-20 system with *files* PS:<JOE>FOO.TXT.1 and PS:<JOE>FOO.TXT.2 might permit the second *file* to be referred to as PS:<JOE>FOO.TXT.0, since the “.0” notation denotes “newest” version of several *files*. In the same *file system*, a “logical device” “JOE:” might be taken to refer to PS:<JOE>” and so the names JOE:FOO.TXT.2 or JOE:FOO.TXT.0 might refer to PS:<JOE>FOO.TXT.2. In all of these cases, the *truename* of the file would probably be PS:<JOE>FOO.TXT.2. 



If a *file* is a symbolic link to another *file* (in a *file system* permitting such a thing), it is conventional for the *truename* to be the canonical name of the *file* after any symbolic links have been followed; that is, it is the canonical name of the *file* whose contents would become available if an *input stream* to that *file* were opened. 



In the case of a *file* still being created (that is, of an *output stream* open to such a *file*), the exact *truename* of the file might not be known until the *stream* is closed. In this case, the *function* **truename** might return different values for such a *stream* before and after it was closed. In fact, before it is closed, the name returned might not even be a valid name in the *file system*—for example, while a file is being written, it might have version :newest and might only take on a specific numeric value later when the file is closed even in a *file system* where all files have numeric versions. 







 



 



**directory** *Function* 



**Syntax:** 



**directory** *pathspec* &key *→ pathnames* 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*pathspec*—a *pathname designator* , which may contain *wild* components. 



*pathnames*—a *list* of *physical pathnames*. 



**Description:** 



Determines which, if any, *files* that are present in the file system have names matching *pathspec*, and returns a *fresh list* of *pathnames* corresponding to the *truenames* of those *files*. 



An *implementation* may be extended to accept *implementation-defined* keyword arguments to **directory**. 



**Affected By:** 



The host computer’s file system. 



**Exceptional Situations:** 



If the attempt to obtain a directory listing is not successful, an error of *type* **file-error** is signaled. 



**See Also:** 



**pathname**, **logical-pathname**, **ensure-directories-exist**, Section 20.1 (File System Concepts), Section 21.1.1.1.2 (Open and Closed Streams), Section 19.1.2 (Pathnames as Filenames) 



**Notes:** 



If the *pathspec* is not *wild*, the resulting list will contain either zero or one elements. 



Common Lisp specifies “&key” in the argument list to **directory** even though no *standardized* keyword arguments to **directory** are defined. “:allow-other-keys t” may be used in *conforming programs* in order to quietly ignore any additional keywords which are passed by the program but not supported by the *implementation*. 



**probe-file** *Function* 



**Syntax:** 



**probe-file** *pathspec → truename* 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*pathspec*—a *pathname designator* . 







 



 



*truename*—a *physical pathname* or **nil**. 



**Description:** 



**probe-file** tests whether a file exists. 



**probe-file** returns *false* if there is no file named *pathspec*, and otherwise returns the *truename* of *pathspec*. 



If the *pathspec designator* is an open *stream*, then **probe-file** produces the *truename* of its associated *file*. If *pathspec* is a *stream*, whether open or closed, it is coerced to a *pathname* as if by the *function* **pathname**. 



**Affected By:** 



The host computer’s file system. 



**Exceptional Situations:** 



An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled if *pathspec* is *wild*. 



An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled if the *file system* cannot perform the requested operation. 



**See Also:** 



**truename**, **open**, **ensure-directories-exist**, **pathname**, **logical-pathname**, Section 20.1 (File System Concepts), Section 21.1.1.1.2 (Open and Closed Streams), Section 19.1.2 (Pathnames as Filenames) 



**ensure-directories-exist** *Function* 



**Syntax:** 



**ensure-directories-exist** *pathspec* &key *verbose → pathspec, created* 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*pathspec*—a *pathname designator* . 



*verbose*—a *generalized boolean*. 



*created*—a *generalized boolean*. 



**Description:** 



Tests whether the directories containing the specified *file* actually exist, and attempts to create them if they do not. 



If the containing directories do not exist and if *verbose* is *true*, then the *implementation* is permitted (but not required) to perform output to *standard output* saying what directories were created. If the containing directories exist, or if *verbose* is *false*, this function performs no output. 







 



 



The *primary value* is the given *pathspec* so that this operation can be straightforwardly composed with other file manipulation expressions. The *secondary value*, *created*, is *true* if any directories were created. 



**Affected By:** 



The host computer’s file system. 



**Exceptional Situations:** 



An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled if the host, device, or directory part of *pathspec* is *wild*. 



If the directory creation attempt is not successful, an error of *type* **file-error** is signaled; if this occurs, it might be the case that none, some, or all of the requested creations have actually occurred within the *file system*.

**probe-file**, **open**, Section 19.1.2 (Pathnames as Filenames) 



**truename** *Function* 



**Syntax:** 



**truename** *filespec → truename* 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*filespec*—a *pathname designator* . 



*truename*—a *physical pathname*. 



**Description:** 



**truename** tries to find the *file* indicated by *filespec* and returns its *truename*. If the *filespec designator* is an open *stream*, its associated *file* is used. If *filespec* is a *stream*, **truename** can be used whether the *stream* is open or closed. It is permissible for **truename** to return more specific information after the *stream* is closed than when the *stream* was open. If *filespec* is a *pathname* it represents the name used to open the file. This may be, but is not required to be, the actual name of the file. 



**Examples:** 



;; An example involving version numbers. Note that the precise nature of 



;; the truename is implementation-dependent while the file is still open. 



(with-open-file (stream ">vistor>test.text.newest") 



(values (pathname stream) 







 



 



(truename stream))) 



*→* #P"S:>vistor>test.text.newest", #P"S:>vistor>test.text.1" 



<i><sup>or</sup>→</i> #P"S:>vistor>test.text.newest", #P"S:>vistor>test.text.newest" 



<i><sup>or</sup>→</i> #P"S:>vistor>test.text.newest", #P"S:>vistor> temp . temp .1" 



;; In this case, the file is closed when the truename is tried, so the 



;; truename information is reliable. 



(with-open-file (stream ">vistor>test.text.newest") 



(close stream) 



(values (pathname stream) 



(truename stream))) 



*→* #P"S:>vistor>test.text.newest", #P"S:>vistor>test.text.1" 



;; An example involving TOP-20’s implementation-dependent concept 



;; of logical devices – in this case, "DOC:" is shorthand for 



;; "PS:<DOCUMENTATION>" ... 



(with-open-file (stream "CMUC::DOC:DUMPER.HLP") 



(values (pathname stream) 



(truename stream))) 



*→* #P"CMUC::DOC:DUMPER.HLP", #P"CMUC::PS:<DOCUMENTATION>DUMPER.HLP.13" 



**Exceptional Situations:** 



An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled if an appropriate *file* cannot be located within the *file system* for the given *filespec*, or if the *file system* cannot perform the requested operation. 



An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled if *pathname* is *wild*. 



**See Also:** 



**pathname**, **logical-pathname**, Section 20.1 (File System Concepts), Section 19.1.2 (Pathnames as Filenames) 



**Notes:** 



**truename** may be used to account for any *filename* translations performed by the *file system*. **file-author** *Function* 



**Syntax:** 



**file-author** *pathspec → author* 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*pathspec*—a *pathname designator* . 



*author*—a *string* or **nil**. 







 



 



**Description:** 



Returns a *string* naming the author of the *file* specified by *pathspec*, or **nil** if the author’s name cannot be determined. 



**Examples:** 



(with-open-file (stream ">relativity>general.text") 



(file-author s)) 



*→* "albert" 



**Affected By:** 



The host computer’s file system. 



Other users of the *file* named by *pathspec*. 



**Exceptional Situations:** 



An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled if *pathspec* is *wild*. 



An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled if the *file system* cannot perform the requested operation. 



**See Also:** 



**pathname**, **logical-pathname**, Section 20.1 (File System Concepts), Section 19.1.2 (Pathnames as Filenames) 



**file-write-date** *Function* 



**Syntax:** 



**file-write-date** *pathspec → date* 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*pathspec*—a *pathname designator* . 



*date*—a *universal time* or **nil**. 



**Description:** 



Returns a *universal time* representing the time at which the *file* specified by *pathspec* was last written (or created), or returns **nil** if such a time cannot be determined. 



**Examples:** 



(with-open-file (s "noel.text" 



:direction :output :if-exists :error) 



(format s "~&Dear Santa,~2%I was good this year. ~ 



Please leave lots of toys.~2%Love, Sue~ 







 



 



~2%attachments: milk, cookies~%") 



(truename s)) 



*→* #P"CUPID:/susan/noel.text" 



(with-open-file (s "noel.text") 



(file-write-date s)) 



*→* 2902600800 



**Affected By:** 



The host computer’s file system. 



**Exceptional Situations:** 



An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled if *pathspec* is *wild*. 



An error of *type* **file-error** is signaled if the *file system* cannot perform the requested operation.

**rename-file** *Function* 



**Syntax:** 



**rename-file** *filespec new-name → defaulted-new-name, old-truename, new-truename* 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*filespec*—a *pathname designator* . 



*new-name*—a *pathname designator* other than a *stream*. 



*defaulted-new-name*—a *pathname* 



*old-truename*—a *physical pathname*. 



*new-truename*—a *physical pathname*. 



**Description:** 



**rename-file** modifies the file system in such a way that the file indicated by *filespec* is renamed to *defaulted-new-name*. 



It is an error to specify a filename containing a *wild* component, for *filespec* to contain a **nil** component where the file system does not permit a **nil** component, or for the result of defaulting missing components of *new-name* from *filespec* to contain a **nil** component where the file system does not permit a **nil** component. 



If *new-name* is a *logical pathname*, **rename-file** returns a *logical pathname* as its *primary value*. 



 



 



**rename-file** returns three values if successful. The *primary value*, *defaulted-new-name*, is the resulting name which is composed of *new-name* with any missing components filled in by performing a **merge-pathnames** operation using *filespec* as the defaults. The *secondary value*, *old-truename*, is the *truename* of the *file* before it was renamed. The *tertiary value*, *new-truename*, is the *truename* of the *file* after it was renamed. 



If the *filespec designator* is an open *stream*, then the *stream* itself and the file associated with it are affected (if the *file system* permits). 



**Examples:** 



;; An example involving logical pathnames. 



(with-open-file (stream "sys:chemistry;lead.text" 



:direction :output :if-exists :error) 



(princ "eureka" stream) 



(values (pathname stream) (truename stream))) 



*→* #P"SYS:CHEMISTRY;LEAD.TEXT.NEWEST", #P"Q:>sys>chem>lead.text.1" 



(rename-file "sys:chemistry;lead.text" "gold.text") 



*→* #P"SYS:CHEMISTRY;GOLD.TEXT.NEWEST", 



#P"Q:>sys>chem>lead.text.1", 



#P"Q:>sys>chem>gold.text.1" 



**Exceptional Situations:** 



If the renaming operation is not successful, an error of *type* **file-error** is signaled. 



An error of *type* **file-error** might be signaled if *filespec* is *wild*. 



**See Also:** 



**truename**, **pathname**, **logical-pathname**, Section 20.1 (File System Concepts), Section 19.1.2 (Pathnames as Filenames) 



**delete-file** *Function* 



**Syntax:** 



**delete-file** *filespec →* **t** 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*filespec*—a *pathname designator* . 



**Description:** 



Deletes the *file* specified by *filespec*. 



If the *filespec designator* is an open *stream*, then *filespec* and the file associated with it are affected (if the file system permits), in which case *filespec* might be closed immediately, and the deletion 







 



 



might be immediate or delayed until *filespec* is explicitly closed, depending on the requirements of the file system. 



It is *implementation-dependent* whether an attempt to delete a nonexistent file is considered to be successful. 



**delete-file** returns *true* if it succeeds, or signals an error of *type* **file-error** if it does not. 



The consequences are undefined if *filespec* has a *wild* component, or if *filespec* has a **nil** component and the file system does not permit a **nil** component. 



**Examples:** 



(with-open-file (s "delete-me.text" :direction :output :if-exists :error)) 



*→* NIL 



(setq p (probe-file "delete-me.text")) *→* #P"R:>fred>delete-me.text.1" 



(delete-file p) *→* T 



(probe-file "delete-me.text") *→ false* 



(with-open-file (s "delete-me.text" :direction :output :if-exists :error) 



(delete-file s)) 



*→* T 



(probe-file "delete-me.text") *→ false* 



**Exceptional Situations:** 



If the deletion operation is not successful, an error of *type* **file-error** is signaled. 



An error of *type* **file-error** might be signaled if *filespec* is *wild*.

**file-error** *Condition Type* 



**Class Precedence List:** 



**file-error**, **error**, **serious-condition**, **condition**, **t** 



**Description:** 



The *type* **file-error** consists of error conditions that occur during an attempt to open or close a file, or during some low-level transactions with a file system. The “offending pathname” is initialized by the :pathname initialization argument to **make-condition**, and is *accessed* by the *function* **file-error-pathname**.
