**20.1.3 Truenames** 

Many *file systems* permit more than one *filename* to designate a particular *file*. 

Even where multiple names are possible, most *file systems* have a convention for generating a canonical *filename* in such situations. Such a canonical *filename* (or the *pathname* representing such a *filename*) is called a *truename*. 

The *truename* of a *file* may differ from other *filenames* for the file because of symbolic links, version numbers, logical device translations in the *file system*, *logical pathname* translations within Common Lisp, or other artifacts of the *file system*. 

The *truename* for a *file* is often, but not necessarily, unique for each *file*. For instance, a Unix *file* with multiple hard links could have several *truenames*.
