 

A *stream*, whether a *character stream* or a *binary stream*, can be an *input stream* (source of data), an *output stream* (sink for data), both, or (*e.g.*, when “:direction :probe” is given to **open**) neither. 

Figure 21–2 shows *operators* relating to *input streams*.

**Figure 21–3. Operators relating to Output Streams.** 

A *stream* that is both an *input stream* and an *output stream* is called a *bidirectional stream*. See the *functions* **input-stream-p** and **output-stream-p**. 

Any of the *operators* listed in Figure 21–2 or Figure 21–3 can be used with *bidirectional streams*. In addition, Figure 21–4 shows a list of *operators* that relate specificaly to *bidirectional streams*.
