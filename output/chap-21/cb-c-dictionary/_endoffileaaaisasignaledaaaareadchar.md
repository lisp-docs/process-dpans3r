**end-of-file** is signaled. **read-char** *Function* 



**Syntax:** 



**read-char** &amp;optional *input-stream eof-error-p eof-value recursive-p → char* 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*input-stream*—an *input stream designator* . The default is *standard input*. 



*eof-error-p*—a *generalized boolean*. The default is *true*. 



*eof-value*—an *object*. The default is **nil**. 



*recursive-p*—a *generalized boolean*. The default is *false*. 



*char*—a *character* or the *eof-value*. 



**Description:** 



**read-char** returns the next *character* from *input-stream*. 



When *input-stream* is an *echo stream*, the character is echoed on *input-stream* the first time the character is seen. Characters that are not echoed by **read-char** are those that were put there by **unread-char** and hence are assumed to have been echoed already by a previous call to **read-char**. 



If *recursive-p* is *true*, this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level call to **read** or a similar *function* used by the *Lisp reader* . 



If an *end of file*<sub>2</sub> occurs and *eof-error-p* is *false*, *eof-value* is returned. 







 



 



**Examples:**
```lisp
 
(with-input-from-string (is "0123") 
(do ((c (read-char is) (read-char is nil ’the-end))) 
((not (characterp c))) 
(format t "&#126;S " c))) 
▷ #\0 #\1 #\2 #\3 
*→* NIL 

```
**Affected By:** 



**\*standard-input\***, **\*terminal-io\***. 



**Exceptional Situations:** 



If an *end of file*<sub>2</sub> occurs before a character can be read, and *eof-error-p* is *true*, an error of *type* **end-of-file** is signaled. 



**See Also:** 



**read-byte**, **read-sequence**, **write-char**, **read** 



**Notes:** 



The corresponding output function is **write-char**. 



**read-char-no-hang** *Function* **Syntax:** 



**read-char-no-hang** &amp;optional *input-stream eof-error-p eof-value recursive-p* 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*→ char* 



*input-stream* – an *input stream designator* . The default is *standard input*. 



*eof-error-p*—a *generalized boolean*. The default is *true*. 



*eof-value*—an *object*. The default is **nil**. 



*recursive-p*—a *generalized boolean*. The default is *false*. 



*char*—a *character* or **nil** or the *eof-value*. 



**Description:** 



**read-char-no-hang** returns a character from *input-stream* if such a character is available. If no character is available, **read-char-no-hang** returns **nil**. 







 



 



If *recursive-p* is *true*, this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level call to **read** or a similar *function* used by the *Lisp reader* . 



If an *end of file*<sub>2</sub> occurs and *eof-error-p* is *false*, *eof-value* is returned. 



**Examples:**
```lisp
 
;; This code assumes an implementation in which a newline is not 
;; required to terminate input from the console. 
(defun test-it () 
(unread-char (read-char)) 
(list (read-char-no-hang) 
(read-char-no-hang) 
(read-char-no-hang))) 
*→* TEST-IT 
;; Implementation A, where a Newline is not required to terminate 
;; interactive input on the console. 
(test-it) 
▷ a 
*→* (#\a NIL NIL) 
;; Implementation B, where a Newline is required to terminate 
;; interactive input on the console, and where that Newline remains 
;; on the input stream. 
(test-it) 
▷ a*←-* 
*→* (#\a #\Newline NIL) 

```
**Affected By:** 



**\*standard-input\***, **\*terminal-io\***. 



**Exceptional Situations:** 



If an *end of file*<sub>2</sub> occurs when *eof-error-p* is *true*, an error of *type* **end-of-file** is signaled . **See Also:** 



**listen** 



**Notes:** 



**read-char-no-hang** is exactly like **read-char**, except that if it would be necessary to wait in order to get a character (as from a keyboard), **nil** is immediately returned without waiting.
