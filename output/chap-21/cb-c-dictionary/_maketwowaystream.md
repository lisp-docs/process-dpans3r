 

**Syntax:** 

**make-two-way-stream** *input-stream output-stream → two-way-stream* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*input-stream*—a *stream*. 

*output-stream*—a *stream*. 

*two-way-stream*—a *two-way stream*. 

**Description:** 

Returns a *two-way stream* that gets its input from *input-stream* and sends its output to *output-stream*. 

**Examples:** 

(with-output-to-string (out) 

(with-input-from-string (in "input...") 

(let ((two (make-two-way-stream in out))) 

(format two "output...") 

(setq what-is-read (read two))))) *→* "output..." 

what-is-read *→* INPUT... 

**Exceptional Situations:** 

Should signal an error of *type* **type-error** if *input-stream* is not an *input stream*. Should signal an error of *type* **type-error** if *output-stream* is not an *output stream*.
