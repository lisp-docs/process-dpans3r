**make-two-way-stream** *Function* 



**Syntax:** 



**make-two-way-stream** *input-stream output-stream → two-way-stream* 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*input-stream*—a *stream*. 



*output-stream*—a *stream*. 



*two-way-stream*—a *two-way stream*. 



**Description:** 



Returns a *two-way stream* that gets its input from *input-stream* and sends its output to *output-stream*. 



**Examples:**
```lisp
 
(with-output-to-string (out) 
(with-input-from-string (in "input...") 
(let ((two (make-two-way-stream in out))) 
(format two "output...") 
(setq what-is-read (read two))))) *→* "output..." 
what-is-read *→* INPUT... 

```
**Exceptional Situations:** 



Should signal an error of *type* **type-error** if *input-stream* is not an *input stream*. Should signal an error of *type* **type-error** if *output-stream* is not an *output stream*.
