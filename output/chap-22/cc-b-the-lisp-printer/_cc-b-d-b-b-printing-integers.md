 



*Integers* are printed in the radix specified by the *current output base* in positional notation, most significant digit first. If appropriate, a radix specifier can be printed; see **\*print-radix\***. If an *integer* is negative, a minus sign is printed and then the absolute value of the *integer* is printed. The *integer* zero is represented by the single digit 0 and never has a sign. A decimal point might be printed, depending on the *value* of **\*print-radix\***. 



For related information about the syntax of an *integer* , see Section 2.3.2.1.1 (Syntax of an Integer).
