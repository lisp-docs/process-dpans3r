 



The characters of the *string* are output in order. If *printer escaping* is enabled, a *double-quote* is output before and after, and all *double-quotes* and *single escapes* are preceded by *backslash*. The printing of *strings* is not affected by **\*print-array\***. Only the *active elements* of the *string* are printed. 



For information on how the *Lisp reader* parses *strings*, see Section 2.4.5 (Double-Quote).
