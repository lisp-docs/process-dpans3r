 



A *bit vector* is printed as #\* followed by the bits of the *bit vector* in order. If **\*print-array\*** is *false*, then the *bit vector* is printed in a format (using #&lt;) that is concise but not readable. Only the *active elements* of the *bit vector* are printed. 



For information on *Lisp reader* parsing of *bit vectors*, see Section 2.4.8.4 (Sharpsign Asterisk).
