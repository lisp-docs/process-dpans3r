 

Formatted output is performed not only by **format**, but by certain other functions that accept a *format control* the way **format** does. For example, error-signaling functions such as **cerror** accept *format controls*. 

Note that the meaning of **nil** and **t** as destinations to **format** are different than those of **nil** and **t** as *stream designators*. 

The ~&#60;i&#62;&#60;sup&#62;âˆ§&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/i&#62; should appear only at the beginning of a ~&#60; clause, because it aborts the entire clause in which it appears (as well as all following clauses).
