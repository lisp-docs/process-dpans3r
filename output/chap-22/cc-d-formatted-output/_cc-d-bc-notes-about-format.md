 



Formatted output is performed not only by **format**, but by certain other functions that accept a *format control* the way **format** does. For example, error-signaling functions such as **cerror** accept *format controls*. 



Note that the meaning of **nil** and **t** as destinations to **format** are different than those of **nil** and **t** as *stream designators*. 



The ~<i><sup>âˆ§</sup></i> should appear only at the beginning of a ~&lt; clause, because it aborts the entire clause in which it appears (as well as all following clauses).
