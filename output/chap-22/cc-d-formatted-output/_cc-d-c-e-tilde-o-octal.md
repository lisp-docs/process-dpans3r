 



This is just like &#126;D but prints in octal radix (radix 8) instead of decimal. The full form is therefore &#126;*mincol*,*padchar*,*commachar*,*comma-interval*O. 



&#126;O binds **\*print-escape\*** to *false*, **\*print-radix\*** to *false*, **\*print-base\*** to 8, and **\*print-readably\*** to *false*.
