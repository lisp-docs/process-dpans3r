 



~[*str0* ~;*str1* ~;*...*~;*strn*~] 



This is a set of control strings, called *clauses*, one of which is chosen and used. The clauses are separated by ~; and the construct is terminated by ~]. For example, 



"~[Siamese~;Manx~;Persian~] Cat" 



The *arg*th clause is selected, where the first clause is number 0. If a prefix parameter is given (as ~*n*[), then the parameter is used instead of an argument. If *arg* is out of range then no clause is selected and no error is signaled. After the selected alternative has been processed, the control string continues after the ~]. 



~[*str0* ~;*str1* ~;*...*~;*strn*~:;*default*~] has a default case. If the *last* ~; used to separate clauses is ~:; instead, then the last clause is an else clause that is performed if no other clause is selected. For example: 



"~[Siamese~;Manx~;Persian~:;Alley~] Cat" 



~:[*alternative*~;*consequent*~] selects the *alternative* control string if *arg* is *false*, and selects the *consequent* control string otherwise. 



~@[*consequent*~] tests the argument. If it is *true*, then the argument is not used up by the ~[ command but remains as the next one to be processed, and the one clause *consequent* is processed. If the *arg* is *false*, then the argument is used up, and the clause is not processed. The clause therefore should normally use exactly one argument, and may expect it to be *non-nil*. For example: 



(setq \*print-level\* nil \*print-length\* 5) 



(format nil 



"~@[ print level = ~D~]~@[ print length = ~D~]" 



\*print-level\* \*print-length\*) 



*→* " print length = 5" 



Note also that 



(format *stream* "...~@[*str*~]..." ...) 



*≡* (format *stream* "...~:[~;~:\**str*~]..." ...) 



The combination of ~[ and # is useful, for example, for dealing with English conventions for printing lists: 



(setq foo "Items:~#[ none~; ~S~; ~S and ~S~ 



~:;~@\&#123;~#[~; and~] ~S~<i><sup>∧</sup></i>,~\&#125;~].") 







 



 



(format nil foo) *→* "Items: none." 



(format nil foo ’foo) *→* "Items: FOO." 



(format nil foo ’foo ’bar) *→* "Items: FOO and BAR." 



(format nil foo ’foo ’bar ’baz) *→* "Items: FOO, BAR, and BAZ." 



(format nil foo ’foo ’bar ’baz ’quux) *→* "Items: FOO, BAR, BAZ, and QUUX."
