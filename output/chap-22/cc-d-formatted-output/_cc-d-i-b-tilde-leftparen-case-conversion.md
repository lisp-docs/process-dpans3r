**22.3.8.1 Tilde Left-Paren: Case Conversion** 

~(*str*~) 

The contained control string *str* is processed, and what it produces is subject to case conversion. With no flags, every *uppercase character* is converted to the corresponding *lowercase character* . ~:( capitalizes all words, as if by **string-capitalize**. 

~@( capitalizes just the first word and forces the rest to lower case. 

~:@( converts every lowercase character to the corresponding uppercase character. 

In this example ~@( is used to cause the first word produced by ~@R to be capitalized: 

(format nil "~@R ~(~@R~)" 14 14) 

*→* "XIV xiv" 

(defun f (n) (format nil "~@(~R~) error~:P detected." n)) *→* F 

(f 0) *→* "Zero errors detected." 

(f 1) *→* "One error detected." 

(f 23) *→* "Twenty-three errors detected." 

When case conversions appear nested, the outer conversion dominates, as illustrated in the following example: 

(format nil "~@(how is ~:(BOB SMITH~)?~)") 

*→* "How is bob smith?" 

\<i\>\<sup\>not\</sup\> →\</i\> "How is Bob Smith?"
