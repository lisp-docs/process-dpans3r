**22.3.8.3 Tilde P: Plural** 

If *arg* is not **eql** to the integer 1, a lowercase s is printed; if *arg* is **eql** to 1, nothing is printed. If *arg* is a floating-point 1.0, the s is printed. 

~:P does the same thing, after doing a ~:\* to back up one argument; that is, it prints a lowercase s if the previous argument was not 1. 

~@P prints y if the argument is 1, or ies if it is not. ~:@P does the same thing, but backs up first.
