**24.1.2 Features**

 

A *feature* is an aspect or attribute of Common Lisp, of the *implementation*, or of the *environment*. A *feature* is identified by a *symbol*. 

A *feature* is said to be *present* in a *Lisp image* if and only if the *symbol* naming it is an *element* of the *list* held by the *variable* **\*features\***, which is called the *features list*.
