 

The top level loop is the Common Lisp mechanism by which the user normally interacts with the Common Lisp system. This loop is sometimes referred to as the *Lisp read-eval-print loop* because it typically consists of an endless loop that reads an expression, evaluates it and prints the results. 

The top level loop is not completely specified; thus the user interface is *implementation-defined*. The top level loop prints all values resulting from the evaluation of a *form*. Figure 25–1 lists variables that are maintained by the *Lisp read-eval-print loop*.
