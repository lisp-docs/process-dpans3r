**25.1.4 Time** 

Time is represented in four different ways in Common Lisp: *decoded time*, *universal time*, *internal time*, and seconds. *Decoded time* and *universal time* are used primarily to represent calendar time, and are precise only to one second. *Internal time* is used primarily to represent measurements of 

computer time (such as run time) and is precise to some *implementation-dependent* fraction of a second called an *internal time unit*, as specified by **internal-time-units-per-second**. An *internal time* can be used for either *absolute* and *relative time* measurements. Both a *universal time* and a *decoded time* can be used only for *absolute time* measurements. In the case of one function, **sleep**, time intervals are represented as a non-negative *real* number of seconds. 

Figure 25–4 shows *defined names* relating to *time*.
