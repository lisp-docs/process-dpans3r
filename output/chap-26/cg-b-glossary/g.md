**G** 



**general** *adj.* (of an *array*) having *element type* **t**, and consequently able to have any *object* as an *element*. 



**generalized boolean** *n.* an *object* used as a truth value, where the symbol **nil** 



represents *false* and all other *objects* represent *true*. See *boolean*. 



**generalized instance** *n.* (of a *class*) an *object* the *class* of which is either that *class* itself, or some subclass of that *class*. (Because of the correspondence between types and classes, the term “generalized instance of *X*” implies “object of type *X*” and in cases where *X* is a *class* (or *class name*) the reverse is also true. The former terminology emphasizes the view of *X* as a *class* while the latter emphasizes the view of *X* as a *type specifier* .) 



**generalized reference** *n.* a reference to a location storing an *object* as if to a 



*variable*. (Such a reference can be either to *read* or *write* the location.) See Section 5.1 (Generalized Reference). See also *place*. 



**generalized synonym stream** *n.* (with a *synonym stream symbol*) 1. (to a *stream*) a *synonym stream* to the *stream*, or a *composite stream* which has as a target a 



*generalized synonym stream* to the *stream*. 2. (to a *symbol*) a *synonym stream* to the *symbol*, or a *composite stream* which has as a target a *generalized synonym stream* to the *symbol*. 



**generic function** *n.* a *function* whose behavior depends on the *classes* or identities of the arguments supplied to it and whose parts include, among other things, a set of *methods*, a *lambda list*, and a *method combination* type. 



**generic function lambda list** *n.* A *lambda list* that is used to describe data flow into a *generic function*. See Section 3.4.2 (Generic Function Lambda Lists). 



**gensym** *n. Trad.* an *uninterned symbol*. See the *function* **gensym**. 







 



 



**global declaration** *n.* a *form* that makes certain kinds of information about code globally available; that is, a **proclaim** *form* or a **declaim** *form*. 



**global environment** *n.* that part of an *environment* that contains *bindings* with *indefinite scope* and *indefinite extent*. 



**global variable** *n.* a *dynamic variable* or a *constant variable*. 



**glyph** *n.* a visual representation. “Graphic characters have associated glyphs.” 



**go** *v.* to transfer control to a *go point*. See the *special operator* **go**. 



**go point** one of possibly several *exit points* that are *established* by **tagbody** (or other abstractions, such as **prog**, which are built from **tagbody**). 



**go tag** *n.* the *symbol* or *integer* that, within the *lexical scope* of a **tagbody** *form*, names an *exit point established* by that **tagbody** *form*. 



**graphic** *adj.* (of a *character* ) being a “printing” or “displayable” *character* that has a standard visual representation as a single *glyph*, such as A or \* or =. *Space* is defined to be *graphic*. Of the *standard characters*, all but *newline* are *graphic*. See *non-graphic*.
