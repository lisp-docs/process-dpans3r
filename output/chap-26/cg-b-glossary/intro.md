Each entry in this glossary has the following parts: 



*•* the term being defined, set in boldface. 



*•* optional pronunciation, enclosed in square brackets and set in boldface, as in the following example: [ **a list** ]. The pronunciation key follows *Webster’s Third New International Dictionary the English Language, Unabridged*, except that “* ” is used to notate the schwa (upside-down “e”) character. 



*•* the part or parts of speech, set in italics. If a term can be used as several parts of speech, there is a separate definition for each part of speech. 



*•* one or more definitions, organized as follows: 



– an optional number, present if there are several definitions. Lowercase letters might also be used in cases where subdefinitions of a numbered definition are necessary. 



– an optional part of speech, set in italics, present if the term is one of several parts of speech. 



– an optional discipline, set in italics, present if the term has a standard definition being repeated. For example, “*Math.*” 



– an optional context, present if this definition is meaningful only in that context. For example, “(of a <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"symbol"}><i>symbol</i></GlossaryTerm>)”. 



– the definition. 



– an optional example sentence. For example, “This is an example of an example.” – optional cross references. 



In addition, some terms have idiomatic usage in the Common Lisp community which is not shared by other communities, or which is not technically correct. Definitions labeled “*Idiom.*” represent such idiomatic usage; these definitions are sometimes followed by an explanatory note. 



Words in *this font* are words with entries in the glossary. Words in example sentences do not follow this convention. 



When an ambiguity arises, the longest matching substring has precedence. For example, “*complex float*” refers to a single glossary entry for “*complex float*” rather than the combined meaning of the glossary terms “<GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"complex"}><i>complex</i></GlossaryTerm>” and “<GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"float"}><i>float</i></GlossaryTerm>.” 







 



 



Subscript notation, as in “<i>something<sub>n</sub></i>” means that the <i>n</i>th definition of “<i>something</i>” is intended. This notation is used only in situations where the context might be insufficient to disambiguate. 



The following are abbreviations used in the glossary:

**Non-alphabetic** 



**()** [ <DictionaryLink styled={true} term={"nil"}><b>nil</b></DictionaryLink> ], *n.* an alternative notation for writing the symbol <DictionaryLink styled={true} term={"nil"}><b>nil</b></DictionaryLink>, used to emphasize the use of <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"nil"}><i>nil</i></GlossaryTerm> as an *empty list*.
