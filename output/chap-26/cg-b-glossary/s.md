**S** 



**safe** *adj.* 1. (of *code*) processed in a *lexical environment* where the the highest **safety** level (3) was in effect. See **optimize**. 2. (of a *call*) a *safe call*. 



**safe call** *n.* a *call* in which the *call*, the *function* being *called*, and the point of *functional evaluation* are all *safe*<sub>1</sub> *code*. For more detailed information, see Section 3.5.1.1 (Safe and Unsafe Calls). 



**same** *adj.* 1. (of *objects* under a specified *predicate*) indistinguishable by that 



*predicate*. “The symbol car, the string "car", and the string "CAR" are the same under **string-equal**”. 2. (of *objects* if no predicate is implied by context) indistinguishable by **eql**. Note that **eq** might be capable of distinguishing some *numbers* and *characters* which **eql** cannot distinguish, but the nature of such, if any, is *implementation* 



*dependent*. Since **eq** is used only rarely in this specification, **eql** is the default predicate when none is mentioned explicitly. “The conses returned by two successive calls to **cons** are never the same.” 3. (of *types*) having the same set of *elements*; that is, each *type* is a *subtype* of the others. “The types specified by (integer 0 1), (unsigned-byte 1), and bit are the same.” 



**satisfy the test** *v.* (of an *object* being considered by a *sequence function*) 1. (for a one *argument* test) to be in a state such that the *function* which is the *predicate argument* to the *sequence function* returns *true* when given a single *argument* that is the result 



of calling the *sequence function*’s *key argument* on the *object* being considered. See Section 17.2.2 (Satisfying a One-Argument Test). 2. (for a two *argument* test) to be in a state such that the two-place *predicate* which is the *sequence function*’s *test* 







 



 



*argument* returns *true* when given a first *argument* that is the *object* being considered, and when given a second *argument* that is the result of calling the *sequence function*’s *key argument* on an *element* of the *sequence function*’s *sequence argument* which is being tested for equality; or to be in a state such that the *test-not function* returns *false* given the same *arguments*. See Section 17.2.1 (Satisfying a Two-Argument Test). 



**scope** *n.* the structural or textual region of code in which *references* to an *object*, a *binding*, an *exit point*, a *tag*, or an *environment* (usually by *name*) can occur. 



**script** *n. ISO* one of possibly several sets that form an *exhaustive partition* of the type **character**. See Section 13.1.2.1 (Character Scripts). 



**secondary value** *n.* (of *values* resulting from the *evaluation* of a *form*) the second *value*, if any, or else **nil** if there are fewer than two *values*. “The secondary value returned by **truncate** is a remainder.” 



**section** *n.* a partitioning of output by a *conditional newline* on a *pretty printing stream*. See Section 22.2.1.1 (Dynamic Control of the Arrangement of Output). 



**self-evaluating object** *n.* an *object* that is neither a *symbol* nor a *cons*. If a 



*self-evaluating object* is *evaluated*, it *yields* itself as its only *value*. “Strings are 



self-evaluating objects.” 



**semi-standard** *adj.* (of a language feature) not required to be implemented by any *conforming implementation*, but nevertheless recommended as the canonical approach in situations where an *implementation* does plan to support such a feature. The presence of *semi-standard* aspects in the language is intended to lessen portability problems and reduce the risk of gratuitous divergence among *implementations* that might stand in the way of future standardization. 



**semicolon** *n.* the *standard character* that is called “semicolon” (;). See Figure 2–5. **sequence** *n.* 1. an ordered collection of elements 2. a *vector* or a *list*. 



**sequence function** *n.* one of the *functions* in Figure 17–1, or an *implementation defined function* that operates on one or more *sequences*. and that is defined by the *implementation* to be a *sequence function*. 



**sequential** *adj. Trad.* (of *binding* or *assignment*) done in the style of **setq**, **let\***, or **do\***; that is, interleaving the evaluation of the *forms* that produce *values* with the *assignments* or *bindings* of the *variables* (or *places*). See *parallel*. 



**sequentially** *adv.* in a *sequential* way. 







 



 



**serious condition** *n.* a *condition* of *type* **serious-condition**, which represents a 



*situation* that is generally sufficiently severe that entry into the *debugger* should be expected if the *condition* is *signaled* but not *handled*. 



**session** *n.* the conceptual aggregation of events in a *Lisp image* from the time it is started to the time it is terminated. 



**set** *v.t. Trad.* (any *variable* or a *symbol* that is the *name* of a *dynamic variable*) to *assign* the *variable*. 



**setf expander** *n.* a function used by **setf** to compute the *setf expansion* of a *place*. 



**setf expansion** *n.* a set of five *expressions*<sub>1</sub> that, taken together, describe how to store into a *place* and which *subforms* of the macro call associated with the *place* are evaluated. See Section 5.1.1.2 (Setf Expansions). 



**setf function** *n.* a *function* whose *name* is (setf *symbol*). 



**setf function name** *n.* (of a *symbol S*) the *list* (setf *S*).

**stack allocate** *v.t. Trad.* to allocate in a non-permanent way, such as on a stack. Stack-allocation is an optimization technique used in some *implementations* for 



allocating certain kinds of *objects* that have *dynamic extent*. Such *objects* are allocated on the stack rather than in the heap so that their storage can be freed as part of unwinding the stack rather than taking up space in the heap until the next garbage collection.

**standard pprint dispatch table** *n.* A *pprint dispatch table* that is *different* from the *initial pprint dispatch table*, that implements *pretty printing* as described in this specification, and that, unlike other *pprint dispatch tables*, must never be modified by any program. (Although the definite reference “the *standard pprint dispatch table*” is generally used within this document, it is actually *implementation-dependent* whether a single *object* fills the role of the *standard pprint dispatch table*, or whether there might be multiple such objects, any one of which could be used on any given occasion where “the *standard pprint dispatch table*” is called for. As such, this phrase should be seen as an indefinite reference in all cases except for anaphoric references.) 



**standard readtable** *n.* A *readtable* that is *different* from the *initial readtable*, that implements the *expression* syntax defined in this specification, and that, unlike 



other *readtables*, must never be modified by any program. (Although the definite reference “the *standard readtable*” is generally used within this document, it is 



actually *implementation-dependent* whether a single *object* fills the role of the *standard readtable*, or whether there might be multiple such objects, any one of which could be used on any given occasion where “the *standard readtable*” is called for. As such, 







 



 



this phrase should be seen as an indefinite reference in all cases except for anaphoric references.)

**stream** *n.* an *object* that can be used with an input or output function to identify an appropriate source or sink of *characters* or *bytes* for that operation. 



**stream associated with a file** *n.* a *file stream*, or a *synonym stream* 



the *target* of which is a *stream associated with a file*. Such a *stream*

**nil** (denoting **\*standard-input\*** for *input stream variable designators* or denoting **\*standard-output\*** for *output stream variable designators*), or some other *symbol* (denoting itself). 



**string** *n.* a specialized *vector* that is of *type* **string**, and whose elements are of *type* **character** or a *subtype* of *type* **character**. 







 



 



**string designator** *n.* a *designator* for a *string*; that is, an *object* that denotes a *string* and that is one of: a *character* (denoting a *singleton string* that has the *character* as its only *element*), a *symbol* (denoting the *string* that is its *name*), or a *string* (denoting itself). The intent is that this term be consistent with the behavior of **string**; *implementations* that extend **string** must extend the meaning of this term in a compatible way. 



**string equal** *adj.* the *same* under **string-equal**. 



**string stream** *n.* a *stream* of *type* **string-stream**.

**subform** *n.* (of a *form*) an *expression* that is a *subexpression* of the *form*, and which by virtue of its position in that *form* is also a *form*. “(f x) and x, but not exit, are subforms of (return-from exit (f x)).” 



**subrepertoire** *n.* a subset of a *repertoire*.

membership of another *type*, called a *supertype*. (Every *type* is a *subtype* of itself.) 



**superclass** *n.* a *class* from which another *class* (called a *subclass*) *inherits*. (No *class* is a *superclass* of itself.) See *subclass*. 



**supertype** *n.* a *type* whose membership is the same as or a proper superset of the membership of another *type*, called a *subtype*. (Every *type* is a *supertype* of itself.) See *subtype*. 







 



 



**supplied-p parameter** *n.* a *parameter* which recieves its *generalized boolean* value implicitly due to the presence or absence of an *argument* corresponding to another *parameter* (such as an *optional parameter* or a *rest parameter* ). See Section 3.4.1 (Ordinary Lambda Lists).

See the *function* **make-synonym-stream**. 2. (to a *stream*) a *synonym stream* which has the *stream* as 



the *value* of its *synonym stream symbol*. 3. (to a *symbol*) a *synonym stream* which has the *symbol* as its *synonym stream symbol*.

**syntax type** *n.* (of a *character* ) one of several classifications, enumerated in Figure 2– 6, that are used for dispatch during parsing by the *Lisp reader* . See Section 2.1.4 (Character Syntax Types). 



**system class** *n.* a *class* that may be of *type* **built-in-class** in a *conforming* 



*implementation* and hence cannot be inherited by *classes* defined by *conforming* 



*programs*. 



**system code** *n. code* supplied by the *implementation* to implement this specification (*e.g.*, the definition of **mapcar**) or generated automatically in support of this 



specification (*e.g.*, during method combination); that is, *code* that is not *programmer code*.
