**3.1.2.1.1.4 Symbols Naming Both Lexical and Dynamic Variables** 

The same *symbol* can name both a *lexical variable* and a *dynamic variable*, but never in the same *lexical environment*. 

In the following example, the *symbol* x is used, at different times, as the *name* of a *lexical variable* and as the *name* of a *dynamic variable*. 

(let ((x 1)) ;Binds a special variable X 

(declare (special x)) 

(let ((x 2)) ;Binds a lexical variable X 

(+ x ;Reads a lexical variable X 

(locally (declare (special x)) 

x)))) ;Reads a special variable X
