 



A *form* that is neither a *symbol* nor a *cons* is defined to be a *self-evaluating object*. *Evaluating* such an *object yields* the *same object* as a result. 



Certain specific *symbols* and *conses* might also happen to be “self-evaluating” but only as a special case of a more general set of rules for the *evaluation* of *symbols* and *conses*; such *objects* are not considered to be *self-evaluating objects*. 



The consequences are undefined if *literal objects* (including *self-evaluating objects*) are destructively modified.
