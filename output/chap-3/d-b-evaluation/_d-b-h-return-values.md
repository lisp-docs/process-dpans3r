 



Ordinarily the result of calling a *function* is a single *object*. Sometimes, however, it is convenient for a function to compute several *objects* and return them. 



In order to receive other than exactly one value from a *form*, one of several *special forms* or *macros* must be used to request those values. If a *form* produces *multiple values* which were not requested in this way, then the first value is given to the caller and all others are discarded; if the *form* produces zero values, then the caller receives **nil** as a value. 



Figure 3–5 lists some *operators* for receiving *multiple values*<sub>2</sub>. These *operators* can be used to specify one or more *forms* to *evaluate* and where to put the *values* returned by those *forms*.

**Figure 3–5. Some operators applicable to receiving multiple values** 



The *function* **values** can produce *multiple values*<sub>2</sub>. (values) returns zero values; (values *form*) returns the *primary value* returned by *form*; (values *form1 form2*) returns two values, the *primary value* of *form1* and the *primary value* of *form2*; and so on.
