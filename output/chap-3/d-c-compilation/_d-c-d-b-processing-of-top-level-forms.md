**3.2.3.1 Processing of Top Level Forms** 

Processing of *top level forms* in the file compiler is defined as follows: 

1\. If the *form* is a *compiler macro form* (not disabled by a **notinline** *declaration*), the *implementation* might or might not choose to compute the *compiler macro expansion* of the *form* and, having performed the expansion, might or might not choose to process the result as a *top level form* in the same processing mode (compile-time-too or not-compile time). If it declines to obtain or use the expansion, it must process the original *form*. 

2\. If the form is a *macro form*, its *macro expansion* is computed and processed as a *top level form* in the same processing mode (compile-time-too or not-compile-time). 

3\. If the form is a **progn** form, each of its body *forms* is sequentially processed as a *top level form* in the same processing mode. 

4\. If the form is a **locally**, **macrolet**, or **symbol-macrolet**, **compile-file** establishes the appropriate bindings and processes the body forms as *top level forms* with those bindings in effect in the same processing mode. (Note that this implies that the lexical *environment* in which *top level forms* are processed is not necessarily the *null lexical environment*.) 

5\. If the form is an **eval-when** form, it is handled according to Figure 3–7.

**Figure 3–7. EVAL-WHEN processing** 

Column **CT** indicates whether :compile-toplevel is specified. Column **LT** indicates whether :load-toplevel is specified. Column **E** indicates whether :execute is specified. Column **Mode** indicates the processing mode; a dash (—) indicates that the processing mode is not relevant. 

The **Action** column specifies one of three actions: 

**Process:** process the body as *top level forms* in the specified mode. 

**Evaluate:** evaluate the body in the dynamic execution context of the compiler, using the *evaluation environment* as the global environment and the *lexical environment* in which the **eval-when** appears. 

**Discard:** ignore the *form*. 

The **New Mode** column indicates the new processing mode. A dash (—) indicates the compiler remains in its current mode. 

6\. Otherwise, the form is a *top level form* that is not one of the special cases. In compile time-too mode, the compiler first evaluates the form in the evaluation *environment* and then minimally compiles it. In not-compile-time mode, the *form* is simply minimally compiled. All *subforms* are treated as *non-top-level forms*. 

Note that *top level forms* are processed in the order in which they textually appear in the file and that each *top level form* read by the compiler is processed before the next is read. However, the order of processing (including macro expansion) of *subforms* that are not *top level forms* and the order of further compilation is unspecified as long as Common Lisp 

semantics are preserved. 

**eval-when** forms cause compile-time evaluation only at top level. Both :compile-toplevel and :load-toplevel situation specifications are ignored for *non-top-level forms*. For *non-top-level*  



*forms*, an **eval-when** specifying the :execute situation is treated as an *implicit progn* including the *forms* in the body of the **eval-when** *form*; otherwise, the *forms* in the body are ignored.
