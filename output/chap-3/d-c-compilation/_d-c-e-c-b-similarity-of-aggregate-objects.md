 



Of the *types* over which *similarity* is defined, some are treated as aggregate objects. For these types, *similarity* is defined recursively. We say that an *object* of these types has certain “basic qualities” and to satisfy the *similarity* relationship, the values of the corresponding qualities of the two *objects* must also be similar.
