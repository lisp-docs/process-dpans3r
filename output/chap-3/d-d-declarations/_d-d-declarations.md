 



*Declarations* provide a way of specifying information for use by program processors, such as the evaluator or the compiler. 



*Local declarations* can be embedded in executable code using **declare**. *Global declarations*, or *proclamations*, are established by **proclaim** or **declaim**. 



The **the** *special form* provides a shorthand notation for making a *local declaration* about the *type* of the *value* of a given *form*. 



The consequences are undefined if a program violates a *declaration* or a *proclamation*.
