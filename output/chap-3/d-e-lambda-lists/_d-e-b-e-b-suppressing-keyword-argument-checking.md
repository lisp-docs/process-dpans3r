 

If **&allow-other-keys** was specified in the *lambda list* of a *function*, *keyword* &#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; *argument* checking is suppressed in calls to that *function*.  



If the :allow-other-keys *argument* is *true* in a call to a *function*, *keyword* &#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; *argument* checking is suppressed in that call. 

The :allow-other-keys *argument* is permissible in all situations involving *keyword* &#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; *arguments*, even when its associated *value* is *false*.
