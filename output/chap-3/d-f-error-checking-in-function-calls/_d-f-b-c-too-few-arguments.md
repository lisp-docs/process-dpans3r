**3.5.1.2 Too Few Arguments** 

It is not permitted to supply too few *arguments* to a *function*. Too few arguments means fewer *arguments* than the number of *required parameters* for the *function*. 

If this *situation* occurs in a *safe call*, an error of *type* **program-error** must be signaled; and in an *unsafe call* the *situation* has undefined consequences.
