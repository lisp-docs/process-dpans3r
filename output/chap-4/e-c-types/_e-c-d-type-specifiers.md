 



*Type specifiers* can be *symbols*, *classes*, or *lists*. Figure 4–2 lists *symbols* that are *standardized atomic type specifiers*, and Figure 4–3 lists *standardized compound type specifier names*. For syntax information, see the dictionary entry for the corresponding *type specifier* . It is possible to define new *type specifiers* using **defclass**, **define-condition**, **defstruct**, or **deftype**.

If a *type specifier* is a *list*, the *car* of the *list* is a *symbol*, and the rest of the *list* is subsidiary *type* information. Such a *type specifier* is called a *compound type specifier*. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, the subsidiary items can be unspecified. The unspecified subsidiary items are indicated by writing \*. For example, to completely specify a *vector* , the *type* of the elements and the length of the *vector* must be present. 



(vector double-float 100) 



The following leaves the length unspecified:  







(vector double-float \*) 



The following leaves the element type unspecified: 



(vector \* 100) 



Suppose that two *type specifiers* are the same except that the first has a \* where the second has a more explicit specification. Then the second denotes a *subtype* of the *type* denoted by the first. 



If a *list* has one or more unspecified items at the end, those items can be dropped. If dropping all occurrences of \* results in a *singleton list*, then the parentheses can be dropped as well (the list can be replaced by the *symbol* in its *car* ). For example, (vector double-float \*) can be abbreviated to (vector double-float), and (vector \* \*) can be abbreviated to (vector) and then to vector.

New *type specifiers* can come into existence in two ways. 



*•* Defining a structure by using **defstruct** without using the :type specifier or defining a *class* by using **defclass** or **define-condition** automatically causes the name of the structure or class to be a new *type specifier symbol*. 



*•* **deftype** can be used to define *derived type specifiers*, which act as ‘abbreviations’ for other *type specifiers*. 



A *class object* can be used as a *type specifier* . When used this way, it denotes the set of all members 











of that *class*. 



Figure 4–5 shows some *defined names* relating to *types* and *declarations*.

Figure 4–6 shows all *defined names* that are *type specifier names*, whether for *atomic type specifiers* or *compound type specifiers*; this list is the union of the lists in Figure 4–2 and Figure 4–3.
