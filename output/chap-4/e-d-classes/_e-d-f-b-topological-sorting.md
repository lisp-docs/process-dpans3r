The class &#60;i&#62;C&#60;/i&#62; is placed first in the result. Remove &#60;i&#62;C&#60;/i&#62; from &#60;i&#62;S&#60;sub&#62;C&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; , and remove all pairs of the form (&#60;i&#62;C, D&#60;/i&#62;), &#60;i&#62;D ∈ S&#60;sub&#62;C&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; , from &#60;i&#62;R&#60;/i&#62;. Repeat the process, adding &#60;i&#62;classes&#60;/i&#62; with no predecessors to the end of the result. Stop when no element can be found that has no predecessor. 

If &#60;i&#62;S&#60;sub&#62;C&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; is not empty and the process has stopped, the set &#60;i&#62;R&#60;/i&#62; is inconsistent. If every &#60;i&#62;class&#60;/i&#62; in the finite set of &#60;i&#62;classes&#60;/i&#62; is preceded by another, then &#60;i&#62;R&#60;/i&#62; contains a loop. That is, there is a chain of classes &#60;i&#62;C&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;i&#62;, . . . , C&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; such that &#60;i&#62;C&#60;sub&#62;i&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; precedes &#60;i&#62;C&#60;sub&#62;i&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62;+1&#60;/sub&#62;, 1 &#60;i&#62;≤ i&#60;/i&#62; &#60; &#60;i&#62;n&#60;/i&#62;, and &#60;i&#62;C&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; precedes &#60;i&#62;C&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62;. 

Sometimes there are several &#60;i&#62;classes&#60;/i&#62; from &#60;i&#62;S&#60;sub&#62;C&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; with no predecessors. In this case select the one that has a direct &#60;i&#62;subclass&#60;/i&#62; rightmost in the &#60;i&#62;class precedence list&#60;/i&#62; computed so far. (If there is no such candidate &#60;i&#62;class&#60;/i&#62;, &#60;i&#62;R&#60;/i&#62; does not generate a partial ordering—the &#60;i&#62;R&#60;sub&#62;c&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62;, &#60;i&#62;c ∈ S&#60;sub&#62;C&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; , are inconsistent.)  



In more precise terms, let &#60;i&#62;&#123;N&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;i&#62;, . . . , N&#60;sub&#62;m&#60;/sub&#62;&#125;&#60;/i&#62;, &#60;i&#62;m ≥&#60;/i&#62; 2, be the &#60;i&#62;classes&#60;/i&#62; from &#60;i&#62;S&#60;sub&#62;C&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; with no predecessors. Let (&#60;i&#62;C&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;i&#62;. . . C&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62;), &#60;i&#62;n ≥&#60;/i&#62; 1, be the &#60;i&#62;class precedence list&#60;/i&#62; constructed so far. &#60;i&#62;C&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; is the most specific &#60;i&#62;class&#60;/i&#62;, and &#60;i&#62;C&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; is the least specific. Let 1 &#60;i&#62;≤ j ≤ n&#60;/i&#62; be the largest number such that there exists an &#60;i&#62;i&#60;/i&#62; where 1 &#60;i&#62;≤ i ≤ m&#60;/i&#62; and &#60;i&#62;N&#60;sub&#62;i&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62;is a direct &#60;i&#62;superclass&#60;/i&#62; of &#60;i&#62;C&#60;sub&#62;j&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; ; &#60;i&#62;N&#60;sub&#62;i&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62;is placed next. 

The effect of this rule for selecting from a set of *classes* with no predecessors is that the *classes* in a simple *superclass* chain are adjacent in the *class precedence list* and that *classes* in each relatively separated subgraph are adjacent in the *class precedence list*. For example, let *T*&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; and *T*&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; be subgraphs whose only element in common is the class *J*. Suppose that no superclass of *J* appears in either *T*&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; or *T*&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;, and that *J* is in the superclass chain of every class in both *T*&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; and *T*&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;. Let *C*&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; be the bottom of *T*&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62;; and let *C*&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; be the bottom of *T*&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;. Suppose *C* is a *class* whose direct *superclasses* are *C*&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; and *C*&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; in that order, then the *class precedence list* for *C* starts with *C* and is followed by all *classes* in *T*&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; except *J*. All the *classes* of *T*&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62; are next. The *class J* and its *superclasses* appear last.
