**setf, psetf** *Macro* 



**Syntax:** 



**setf** *\&#123;#pair\&#125;*\* *! \&#123;result\&#125;*\* 



**psetf** *\&#123;#pair\&#125;*\* *!* **nil** 



*pair::*=*place newvalue* 



Data and Control 



 



 



**setf, psetf** 



**Arguments and Values:** 



*place*—a *place*. 



*newvalue*—a *form*. 



*results*—the *multiple values*<sub>2</sub> returned by the storing form for the last *place*, or **nil** if there are no *pairs*. 



**Description:** 



**setf** changes the *value* of *place* to be *newvalue*. 



(setf place newvalue) expands into an update form that stores the result of evaluating *newvalue* into the location referred to by *place*. Some *place* forms involve uses of accessors that take optional arguments. Whether those optional arguments are permitted by **setf**, or what their use is, is up to the **setf** expander function and is not under the control of **setf**. The documentation for any *function* that accepts **&optional**, **&rest**, or &key arguments and that claims to be usable with **setf** must specify how those arguments are treated. 



If more than one *pair* is supplied, the *pairs* are processed sequentially; that is, 



(setf place-1 newvalue-1 



place-2 newvalue-2 



... 



place-N newvalue-N) 



is precisely equivalent to 



(progn (setf place-1 newvalue-1) 



(setf place-2 newvalue-2) 



... 



(setf place-N newvalue-N)) 



For **psetf**, if more than one *pair* is supplied then the assignments of new values to places are done in parallel. More precisely, all *subforms* (in both the *place* and *newvalue forms*) that are to be evaluated are evaluated from left to right; after all evaluations have been performed, all of the assignments are performed in an unpredictable order. 



For detailed treatment of the expansion of **setf** and **psetf**, see Section 5.1.2 (Kinds of Places). **Examples:**
```lisp
 



(setq x (cons ’a ’b) y (list 1 2 3)) *!* (1 2 3) 



(setf (car x) ’x (cadr y) (car x) (cdr x) y) *!* (1 X 3) 



x *!* (X 1 X 3) 



y *!* (1 X 3) 



(setq x (cons ’a ’b) y (list 1 2 3)) *!* (1 2 3) 



(psetf (car x) ’x (cadr y) (car x) (cdr x) y) *!* NIL 



x *!* (X 1 A 3) 







 



 



y *!* (1 A 3)
