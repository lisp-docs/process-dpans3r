 

An extended **loop** *form* is one that has a body containing *atomic expressions*. When the **loop** *macro* processes such a *form*, it invokes a facility that is commonly called “the Loop Facility.” 

The Loop Facility provides standardized access to mechanisms commonly used in iterations through Loop schemas, which are introduced by *loop keywords*. 

The body of an extended **loop** *form* is divided into **loop** clauses, each which is in turn made up of *loop keywords* and *forms*.
