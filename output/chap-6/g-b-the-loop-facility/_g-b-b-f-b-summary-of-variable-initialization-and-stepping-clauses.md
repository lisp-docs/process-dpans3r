**6.1.1.5.1 Summary of Variable Initialization and Stepping Clauses** 

The for and as constructs provide iteration control clauses that establish a variable to be initialized. for and as clauses can be combined with the loop keyword and to get *parallel* initialization and *stepping*\<sub\>1\</sub\>. Otherwise, the initialization and *stepping*\<sub\>1\</sub\> are *sequential*. 

The with construct is similar to a single **let** clause. with clauses can be combined using the *loop keyword* and to get *parallel* initialization. 

For more information, see Section 6.1.2 (Variable Initialization and Stepping Clauses).
