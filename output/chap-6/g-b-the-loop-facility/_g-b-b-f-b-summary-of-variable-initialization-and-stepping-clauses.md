 

The for and as constructs provide iteration control clauses that establish a variable to be initialized. for and as clauses can be combined with the loop keyword and to get *parallel* initialization and *stepping*&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62;. Otherwise, the initialization and *stepping*&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; are *sequential*. 

The with construct is similar to a single **let** clause. with clauses can be combined using the *loop keyword* and to get *parallel* initialization. 

For more information, see Section 6.1.2 (Variable Initialization and Stepping Clauses).
