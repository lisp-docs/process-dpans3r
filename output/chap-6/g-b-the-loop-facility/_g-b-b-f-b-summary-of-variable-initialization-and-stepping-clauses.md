 



The for and as constructs provide iteration control clauses that establish a variable to be initialized. for and as clauses can be combined with the loop keyword and to get <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"parallel"}><i>parallel</i></GlossaryTerm> initialization and *stepping*<sub>1</sub>. Otherwise, the initialization and *stepping*<sub>1</sub> are <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"sequential"}><i>sequential</i></GlossaryTerm>. 



The with construct is similar to a single <DictionaryLink styled={true} term={"let"}><b>let</b></DictionaryLink> clause. with clauses can be combined using the *loop keyword* and to get <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"parallel"}><i>parallel</i></GlossaryTerm> initialization.
