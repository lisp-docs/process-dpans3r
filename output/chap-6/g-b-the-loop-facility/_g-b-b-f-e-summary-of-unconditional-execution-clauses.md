 



The do (or doing) construct evaluates all *forms* in its clause. 



The return construct takes one *form*. Any *values* returned by the *form* are immediately returned by the **loop** form. It is equivalent to the clause do (return-from *block-name value*), where *block-name* is the name specified in a named clause, or **nil** if there is no named clause. 



For more information, see Section 6.1.5 (Unconditional Execution Clauses).
