 



In the *for-as-equals-then* subclause the for or as construct initializes the variable *var* by setting it to the result of evaluating *form1* on the first iteration, then setting it to the result of evaluating *form2* on the second and subsequent iterations. If *form2* is omitted, the construct uses *form1* on the second and subsequent iterations. The *loop keywords* = and then serve as valid prepositions in this syntax. This construct does not provide any termination tests.
