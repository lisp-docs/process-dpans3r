 



In the *for-as-across* subclause the for or as construct binds the variable *var* to the value of each element in the array *vector*. The *loop keyword* across marks the array *vector*; across is used as a preposition in this syntax. Iteration stops when there are no more elements in the supplied *array* 



that can be referenced. Some implementations might recognize a **the** special form in the *vector* form to produce more efficient code.
