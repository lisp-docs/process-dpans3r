**6.1.2.1.7 The for-as-package subclause** 

In the *for-as-package* subclause the for or as construct iterates over the *symbols* in a *package*. In this syntax, a compound preposition is used to designate access to a *package*. The variable *var* takes on the value of each *symbol* in the supplied *package*. The following *loop keywords* serve as valid prepositions within this syntax: 

being 

The keyword being introduces either the Loop schema symbol, present-symbol, or external-symbol. 

each, the 

The *loop keyword* each follows the *loop keyword* being when symbol, present-symbol, or external-symbol is used. The *loop keyword* the is used with symbols, present-symbols, and external-symbols only for ease of reading. This agreement isnâ€™t required. 

present-symbol, present-symbols 

These Loop schemas iterate over the *symbols* that are *present* in a *package*. The *package* to be iterated over is supplied in the same way that *package* arguments to **find-package** are supplied. If the *package* for the iteration is not supplied, the *current package* is used. If a *package* that does not exist is supplied, an error of *type* **package-error** is signaled. 

symbol, symbols 

These Loop schemas iterate over *symbols* that are *accessible* in a given *package*. The *package* to be iterated over is supplied in the same way that *package* arguments to **find-package** are supplied. If the *package* for the iteration is not supplied, the *current package* is used. If a *package* that does not exist is supplied, an error of *type* **package-error** is signaled. 

external-symbol, external-symbols 

These Loop schemas iterate over the *external symbols* of a *package*. The *package* to be iterated over is supplied in the same way that *package* arguments to **find-package** are 



 

 

supplied. If the *package* for the iteration is not supplied, the *current package* is used. If a *package* that does not exist is supplied, an error of *type* **package-error** is signaled.

These loop prepositions introduce *package*. 

In effect 

being *\{*each *|* the*\} \{*symbol *|* symbols *|* present-symbol *|* present-symbols *|* external-symbol *|* external-symbols*\} \{*in *|* of*\}* 

is a compound preposition. 

Iteration stops when there are no more *symbols* to be referenced in the supplied *package*.
