**6.1.2.1 Iteration Control** 

Iteration control clauses allow direction of **loop** iteration. The *loop keywords* for and as designate iteration control clauses. Iteration control clauses differ with respect to the specification of termination tests and to the initialization and *stepping*\<sub\>1\</sub\> of loop variables. Iteration clauses by themselves do not cause the Loop Facility to return values, but they can be used in conjunction with value-accumulation clauses to return values. 

All variables are initialized in the loop prologue. A *variable binding* has *lexical scope* unless it is proclaimed **special**; thus, by default, the variable can be *accessed* only by *forms* that lie textually within the **loop**. Stepping assignments are made in the loop body before any other *forms* are evaluated in the body. 

The variable argument in iteration control clauses can be a destructuring list. A destructuring list is a *tree* whose *non-nil atoms* are *variable names*. See Section 6.1.1.7 (Destructuring). 

The iteration control clauses for, as, and repeat must precede any other loop clauses, except initially, with, and named, since they establish variable *bindings*. When iteration control clauses are used in a **loop**, the corresponding termination tests in the loop body are evaluated before any other loop body code is executed. 

If multiple iteration clauses are used to control iteration, variable initialization and *stepping*\<sub\>1\</sub\> occur *sequentially* by default. The and construct can be used to connect two or more iteration clauses when *sequential binding* and *stepping*\<sub\>1\</sub\> are not necessary. The iteration behavior of clauses joined by and is analogous to the behavior of the macro **do** with respect to **do\***. 



 

 

The for and as clauses iterate by using one or more local loop variables that are initialized to some value and that can be modified or *stepped* \<sub\>1\</sub\> after each iteration. For these clauses, iteration terminates when a local variable reaches some supplied value or when some other loop clause terminates iteration. At each iteration, variables can be *stepped* \<sub\>1\</sub\> by an increment or a decrement or can be assigned a new value by the evaluation of a *form*). Destructuring can be used to assign values to variables during iteration. 

The for and as keywords are synonyms; they can be used interchangeably. There are seven syntactic formats for these constructs. In each syntactic format, the *type* of *var* can be supplied by the optional *type-spec* argument. If *var* is a destructuring list, the *type* supplied by the *type-spec* argument must appropriately match the elements of the list. By convention, for introduces new iterations and as introduces iterations that depend on a previous iteration specification.
