 

The constructs collect, collecting, append, appending, nconc, nconcing, count, counting, maximize, maximizing, minimize, minimizing, sum, and summing, allow values to be accumulated in a **loop**. 

The constructs collect, collecting, append, appending, nconc, and nconcing, designate clauses that accumulate values in *lists* and return them. The constructs count, counting, maximize, maximizing, minimize, minimizing, sum, and summing designate clauses that accumulate and return numerical values. 

During each iteration, the constructs collect and collecting collect the value of the supplied *form* into a *list*. When iteration terminates, the *list* is returned. The argument *var* is set to the *list* of collected values; if *var* is supplied, the **loop** does not return the final *list* automatically. If *var* is not supplied, it is equivalent to supplying an internal name for *var* and returning its value in a finally clause. The *var* argument is bound as if by the construct with. No mechanism is provided for declaring the *type* of *var*; it must be of *type* **list**. 

The constructs append, appending, nconc, and nconcing are similar to collect except that the values of the supplied *form* must be *lists*. 



 

 

*•* The append keyword causes its *list* values to be concatenated into a single *list*, as if they were arguments to the *function* **append**. 

*•* The nconc keyword causes its *list* values to be concatenated into a single *list*, as if they were arguments to the *function* **nconc**. 

The argument *var* is set to the *list* of concatenated values; if *var* is supplied, **loop** does not return the final *list* automatically. The *var* argument is bound as if by the construct with. A *type* cannot be supplied for *var*; it must be of *type* **list**. The construct nconc destructively modifies its argument *lists*. 

The count construct counts the number of times that the supplied *form* returns *true*. The argument *var* accumulates the number of occurrences; if *var* is supplied, **loop** does not return the final count automatically. The *var* argument is bound as if by the construct with to a zero of the appropriate type. Subsequent values (including any necessary coercions) are computed as if by the function **1+**. If into *var* is used, a *type* can be supplied for *var* with the *type-spec* argument; the consequences are unspecified if a nonnumeric *type* is supplied. If there is no into variable, the optional *type-spec* argument applies to the internal variable that is keeping the count. The default *type* is *implementation-dependent*; but it must be a *supertype* of *type* **fixnum**. 

The maximize and minimize constructs compare the value of the supplied *form* obtained during the first iteration with values obtained in successive iterations. The maximum (for maximize) or minimum (for minimize) value encountered is determined (as if by the *function* **max** for maximize and as if by the *function* **min** for minimize) and returned. If the maximize or minimize clause is never executed, the accumulated value is unspecified. The argument *var* accumulates the maximum or minimum value; if *var* is supplied, **loop** does not return the maximum or minimum automatically. The *var* argument is bound as if by the construct with. If into *var* is used, a *type* can be supplied for *var* with the *type-spec* argument; the consequences are unspecified if a nonnumeric *type* is supplied. If there is no into variable, the optional *type-spec* argument applies to the internal variable that is keeping the maximum or minimum value. The default *type* is *implementation-dependent*; but it must be a *supertype* of *type* **real**. 

The sum construct forms a cumulative sum of the successive *primary values* of the supplied *form* at each iteration. The argument *var* is used to accumulate the sum; if *var* is supplied, **loop** does not return the final sum automatically. The *var* argument is bound as if by the construct with to a zero of the appropriate type. Subsequent values (including any necessary coercions) are computed as if by the *function* **+**. If into *var* is used, a *type* can be supplied for *var* with the *type-spec* argument; the consequences are unspecified if a nonnumeric *type* is supplied. If there is no into variable, the optional *type-spec* argument applies to the internal variable that is keeping the sum. The default *type* is *implementation-dependent*; but it must be a *supertype* of *type* **number**. 

If into is used, the construct does not provide a default return value; however, the variable is available for use in any finally clause. 

Certain kinds of accumulation clauses can be combined in a **loop** if their destination is the same (the result of **loop** or an into *var*) because they are considered to accumulate conceptually compatible quantities. In particular, any elements of following sets of accumulation clauses can be 



 

 

mixed with other elements of the same set for the same destination in a **loop** *form*: *•* collect, append, nconc 

*•* sum, count 

*•* maximize, minimize

Any two clauses that do not accumulate the same *type* of *object* can coexist in a **loop** only if each clause accumulates its values into a different *variable*.
