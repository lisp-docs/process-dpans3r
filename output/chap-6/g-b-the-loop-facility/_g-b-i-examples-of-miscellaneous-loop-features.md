(let ((i 0)) ; no loop keywords are used 

(loop (incf i) (if (= i 3) (return i)))) *→* 3 

(let ((i 0)(j 0)) 

(tagbody 

(loop (incf j 3) (incf i) (if (= i 3) (go exit))) 

exit) 

j) *→* 9 

In the following example, the variable x is stepped before y is stepped; thus, the value of y reflects the updated value of x: 

(loop for x from 1 to 10 

for y = nil then x 

collect (list x y)) 

*→* ((1 NIL) (2 2) (3 3) (4 4) (5 5) (6 6) (7 7) (8 8) (9 9) (10 10)) 

In this example, x and y are stepped in *parallel*: 

(loop for x from 1 to 10 

and y = nil then x 

collect (list x y)) 

*→* ((1 NIL) (2 1) (3 2) (4 3) (5 4) (6 5) (7 6) (8 7) (9 8) (10 9))
