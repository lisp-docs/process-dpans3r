 



In order to make the <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"instance"}><i>instance</i></GlossaryTerm> conform to the class *C*<sub>to</sub>, *local slots* specified by the class *C*<sub>to</sub> that are not specified by the class *C*<sub>from</sub> are added, and *local slots* not specified by the class *C*<sub>to</sub> that are specified by the class *C*<sub>from</sub> are discarded. 



The values of *local slots* specified by both the class *C*<sub>to</sub> and the class *C*<sub>from</sub> are retained. If such a *local slot* was unbound, it remains unbound. 



The values of <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"slot"}><i>slots</i></GlossaryTerm> specified as shared in the class *C*<sub>from</sub> and as local in the class *C*<sub>to</sub> are retained. This first step of the update does not affect the values of any *shared slots*.
