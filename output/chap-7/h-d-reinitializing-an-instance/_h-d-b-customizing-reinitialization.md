 

*Methods* for **reinitialize-instance** may be defined to specify actions to be taken when an *instance* is updated. If only *after methods* for **reinitialize-instance** are defined, they will be run after the system-supplied primary *method* for initialization and therefore will not interfere with the default behavior of **reinitialize-instance**. 

*Methods* for **shared-initialize** may be defined to customize *class* redefinition. For more information, see Section 7.1.5 (Shared-Initialize).
