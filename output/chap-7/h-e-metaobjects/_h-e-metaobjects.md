 



The implementation of the object system manipulates *classes*, *methods*, and *generic functions*. The object system contains a set of *generic functions* defined by *methods* on *classes*; the behavior of those *generic functions* defines the behavior of the object system. The *instances* of the *classes* on which those *methods* are defined are called meta-objects.
