 



The object system provides a set of built-in method combination types. To specify that a generic function is to use one of these method combination types, the name of the method combination type is given as the argument to the :method-combination option to **defgeneric** or to the :method-combination option to any of the other operators that specify generic function options. 



The names of the built-in method combination types are listed in Figure 7–2.

**Figure 7–2. Built-in Method Combination Types** 



The semantics of the **standard** built-in method combination type is described in Section 7.6.6.2 (Standard Method Combination). The other built-in method combination types are called simple built-in method combination types. 



The simple built-in method combination types act as though they were defined by the short form of **define-method-combination**. They recognize two roles for *methods*: 



*•* An *around method* has the keyword symbol :around as its sole *qualifier* . The meaning of :around *methods* is the same as in standard method combination. Use of the functions **call-next-method** and **next-method-p** is supported in *around methods*. 



*•* A primary method has the name of the method combination type as its sole *qualifier* . For example, the built-in method combination type and recognizes methods whose sole *qualifier* is and; these are primary methods. Use of the functions **call-next-method** and **next-method-p** is not supported in *primary methods*. 



The semantics of the simple built-in method combination types is as follows: 



*•* If there are any *around methods*, the most specific *around method* is called. It supplies the value or values of the *generic function*. 



*•* Inside the body of an *around method*, the function **call-next-method** can be used to call the *next method*. The *generic function* **no-next-method** is invoked if **call-next-method** is used and there is no applicable method to call. The *function* **next-method-p** may be used to determine whether a *next method* exists. When the *next method* returns, the *around method* can execute more code, perhaps based on the returned value or values. 







 



 



*•* If an *around method* invokes **call-next-method**, the next most specific *around method* is called, if one is applicable. If there are no *around methods* or if **call-next-method** is called by the least specific *around method*, a Lisp form derived from the name of the built-in method combination type and from the list of applicable primary methods is evaluated to produce the value of the generic function. Suppose the name of the method combination type is *operator* and the call to the generic function is of the form 



(<i>generic-function a</i><sub>1</sub> <i>. . . a<sub>n</sub></i>) 



Let <i>M</i><sub>1</sub><i>, . . . , M<sub>k</sub></i> be the applicable primary methods in order; then the derived Lisp form is (<i>operator hM</i><sub>1</sub> <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> <i>. . . a<sub>n</sub>i. . .hM<sub>k</sub> a</i><sub>1</sub> <i>. . . a<sub>n</sub>i</i>) 



If the expression <i>hM<sub>i</sub> a</i><sub>1</sub> <i>. . . a<sub>n</sub>i</i> is evaluated, the method <i>M<sub>i</sub></i> will be applied to the arguments <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> <i>. . . a<sub>n</sub></i>. For example, if <i>operator</i> is or, the expression <i>hM<sub>i</sub> a</i><sub>1</sub> <i>. . . a<sub>n</sub>i</i> is evaluated only if <i>hM<sub>j</sub> a</i><sub>1</sub> <i>. . . a<sub>n</sub>i</i>, 1 <i>≤ j</i> &lt; <i>i</i>, returned nil. 



The default order for the primary methods is :most-specific-first. However, the order can be reversed by supplying :most-specific-last as the second argument to the :method-combination option. 



The simple built-in method combination types require exactly one *qualifier* per method. An error is signaled if there are applicable methods with no *qualifiers* or with *qualifiers* that are not supported by the method combination type. An error is signaled if there are applicable *around methods* and no applicable primary methods.
