 

The object system provides a set of built-in method combination types. To specify that a generic function is to use one of these method combination types, the name of the method combination type is given as the argument to the :method-combination option to **defgeneric** or to the :method-combination option to any of the other operators that specify generic function options. 

The names of the built-in method combination types are listed in Figure 7–2.

**Figure 7–2. Built-in Method Combination Types** 

The semantics of the **standard** built-in method combination type is described in Section 7.6.6.2 (Standard Method Combination). The other built-in method combination types are called simple built-in method combination types. 

The simple built-in method combination types act as though they were defined by the short form of **define-method-combination**. They recognize two roles for *methods*: 

*•* An *around method* has the keyword symbol :around as its sole *qualifier* . The meaning of :around *methods* is the same as in standard method combination. Use of the functions **call-next-method** and **next-method-p** is supported in *around methods*. 

*•* A primary method has the name of the method combination type as its sole *qualifier* . For example, the built-in method combination type and recognizes methods whose sole *qualifier* is and; these are primary methods. Use of the functions **call-next-method** and **next-method-p** is not supported in *primary methods*. 

The semantics of the simple built-in method combination types is as follows: 

*•* If there are any *around methods*, the most specific *around method* is called. It supplies the value or values of the *generic function*. 

*•* Inside the body of an *around method*, the function **call-next-method** can be used to call the *next method*. The *generic function* **no-next-method** is invoked if **call-next-method** is used and there is no applicable method to call. The *function* **next-method-p** may be used to determine whether a *next method* exists. When the *next method* returns, the *around method* can execute more code, perhaps based on the returned value or values. 



 

 

*•* If an *around method* invokes **call-next-method**, the next most specific *around method* is called, if one is applicable. If there are no *around methods* or if **call-next-method** is called by the least specific *around method*, a Lisp form derived from the name of the built-in method combination type and from the list of applicable primary methods is evaluated to produce the value of the generic function. Suppose the name of the method combination type is *operator* and the call to the generic function is of the form 

(&#60;i&#62;generic-function a&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;i&#62;. . . a&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62;) 

Let &#60;i&#62;M&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;i&#62;, . . . , M&#60;sub&#62;k&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; be the applicable primary methods in order; then the derived Lisp form is (&#60;i&#62;operator hM&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;i&#62;a&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;i&#62;. . . a&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;i. . .hM&#60;sub&#62;k&#60;/sub&#62; a&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;i&#62;. . . a&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;i&#60;/i&#62;) 

If the expression &#60;i&#62;hM&#60;sub&#62;i&#60;/sub&#62; a&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;i&#62;. . . a&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;i&#60;/i&#62; is evaluated, the method &#60;i&#62;M&#60;sub&#62;i&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62; will be applied to the arguments &#60;i&#62;a&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;i&#62;. . . a&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/i&#62;. For example, if &#60;i&#62;operator&#60;/i&#62; is or, the expression &#60;i&#62;hM&#60;sub&#62;i&#60;/sub&#62; a&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;i&#62;. . . a&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;i&#60;/i&#62; is evaluated only if &#60;i&#62;hM&#60;sub&#62;j&#60;/sub&#62; a&#60;/i&#62;&#60;sub&#62;1&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;i&#62;. . . a&#60;sub&#62;n&#60;/sub&#62;i&#60;/i&#62;, 1 &#60;i&#62;≤ j&#60;/i&#62; &#60; &#60;i&#62;i&#60;/i&#62;, returned nil. 

The default order for the primary methods is :most-specific-first. However, the order can be reversed by supplying :most-specific-last as the second argument to the :method-combination option. 

The simple built-in method combination types require exactly one *qualifier* per method. An error is signaled if there are applicable methods with no *qualifiers* or with *qualifiers* that are not supported by the method combination type. An error is signaled if there are applicable *around methods* and no applicable primary methods.
