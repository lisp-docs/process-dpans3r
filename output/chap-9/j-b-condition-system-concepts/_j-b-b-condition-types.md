**Figure 9–1. Standardized Condition Types** 

All *condition* types are *subtypes* of *type* **condition**. That is, 

(typep *c* ’condition) *→ true* 

if and only if *c* is a *condition*. 

*Implementations* must define all specified *subtype* relationships. Except where noted, all *subtype* relationships indicated in this document are not mutually exclusive. A *condition* inherits the structure of its *supertypes*. 

The metaclass of the *class* **condition** is not specified. *Names* of *condition types* may be used to specify *supertype* relationships in **define-condition**, but the consequences are not specified if an attempt is made to use a *condition type* as a *superclass* in a **defclass** *form*. 

Figure 9–2 shows *operators* that define *condition types* and creating *conditions*.
