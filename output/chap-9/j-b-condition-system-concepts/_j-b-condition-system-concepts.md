 



Common Lisp constructs are described not only in terms of their behavior in situations during which they are intended to be used (see the “Description” part of each *operator* specification), but in all other situations (see the “Exceptional Situations” part of each *operator* specification). 



A situation is the evaluation of an expression in a specific context. A *condition* is an *object* that represents a specific situation that has been detected. *Conditions* are *generalized instances* of the *class* **condition**. A hierarchy of *condition* classes is defined in Common Lisp. A *condition* has *slots* that contain data relevant to the situation that the *condition* represents. 



An error is a situation in which normal program execution cannot continue correctly without some form of intervention (either interactively by the user or under program control). Not all errors are detected. When an error goes undetected, the effects can be *implementation-dependent*, *implementation-defined*, unspecified, or undefined. See Section 1.4 (Definitions). All detected errors can be represented by *conditions*, but not all *conditions* represent errors. 



Signaling is the process by which a *condition* can alter the flow of control in a program by raising the *condition* which can then be *handled*. The functions **error**, **cerror**, **signal**, and **warn** are used to signal *conditions*. 



The process of signaling involves the selection and invocation of a *handler* from a set of *active handlers*. A *handler* is a *function* of one argument (the *condition*) that is invoked to handle a *condition*. Each *handler* is associated with a *condition type*, and a *handler* will be invoked only on a *condition* of the *handler* ’s associated *type*. 



*Active handlers* are *established* dynamically (see **handler-bind** or **handler-case**). *Handlers* are invoked in a *dynamic environment* equivalent to that of the signaler, except that the set of *active handlers* is bound in such a way as to include only those that were *active* at the time the *handler* being invoked was *established*. Signaling a *condition* has no side-effect on the *condition*, and there is no dynamic state contained in a *condition*. 



If a *handler* is invoked, it can address the *situation* in one of three ways: 



**Decline** 



It can decline to *handle* the *condition*. It does this by simply returning rather than transferring control. When this happens, any values returned by the handler are ignored and the next most recently established handler is invoked. If there is no such handler and the signaling function is **error** or **cerror**, the debugger is entered in the *dynamic environment* of the signaler. If there is no such handler and the signaling function is either **signal** or **warn**, the signaling function simply returns **nil**. 



**Handle** 



It can *handle* the *condition* by performing a non-local transfer of control. This can be done either primitively by using **go**, **return**, **throw** or more abstractly by using a function such as **abort** or **invoke-restart**. 







 



 



**Defer** 



It can put off a decision about whether to *handle* or *decline*, by any of a number of actions, but most commonly by signaling another condition, resignaling the same condition, or forcing entry into the debugger.
