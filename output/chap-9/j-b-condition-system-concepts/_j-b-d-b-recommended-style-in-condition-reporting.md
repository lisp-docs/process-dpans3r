 



In order to ensure a properly aesthetic result when presenting *report messages* to the user, certain stylistic conventions are recommended. 



There are stylistic recommendations for the content of the messages output by *condition reporters*, but there are no formal requirements on those <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"program"}><i>programs</i></GlossaryTerm>. If a <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"program"}><i>program</i></GlossaryTerm> violates the recommendations for some message, the display of that message might be less aesthetic than if the guideline had been observed, but the <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"program"}><i>program</i></GlossaryTerm> is still considered a *conforming program*. 



The requirements on a <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"program"}><i>program</i></GlossaryTerm> or <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"implementation"}><i>implementation</i></GlossaryTerm> which invokes a *condition reporter* are somewhat stronger. A *conforming program* must be permitted to assume that if these style guidelines are followed, proper aesthetics will be maintained. Where appropriate, any specific requirements on such routines are explicitly mentioned below.
