**condition** *Condition Type* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**condition**, **t** 

**Description:** 

All types of *conditions*, whether error or non-error, must inherit from this *type*. 

No additional *subtype* relationships among the specified *subtypes* of *type* **condition** are allowed, except when explicitly mentioned in the text; however implementations are permitted to introduce additional *types* and one of these *types* can be a *subtype* of any number of the *subtypes* of *type* **condition**. 

Whether a user-defined *condition type* has *slots* that are accessible by *with-slots* is *implementation dependent*. Furthermore, even in an *implementation* in which user-defined *condition types* would have *slots*, it is *implementation-dependent* whether any *condition types* defined in this document have such *slots* or, if they do, what their *names* might be; only the reader functions documented by this specification may be relied upon by portable code. 

*Conforming code* must observe the following restrictions related to *conditions*: 

*•* **define-condition**, not **defclass**, must be used to define new *condition types*. 

*•* **make-condition**, not **make-instance**, must be used to create *condition objects* explicitly. 

*•* The :report option of **define-condition**, not **defmethod** for **print-object**, must be used to define a condition reporter. 

*•* **slot-value**, **slot-boundp**, **slot-makunbound**, and **with-slots** must not be used on *condition objects*. Instead, the appropriate accessor functions (defined by **define-condition**) should be used. 

**warning** *Condition Type* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**warning**, **condition**, **t** 

**Description:** 

The *type* **warning** consists of all types of warnings. 

Conditions **9–11**

 

 

**See Also:** 

**style-warning** 

**style-warning** *Condition Type* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**style-warning**, **warning**, **condition**, **t** 

**Description:** 

The *type* **style-warning** includes those *conditions* that represent *situations* involving *code* that is *conforming code* but that is nevertheless considered to be faulty or substandard. 

**See Also:** 

**muffle-warning** 

**Notes:** 

An *implementation* might signal such a *condition* if it encounters *code* that uses deprecated features or that appears unaesthetic or inefficient. 

An ‘unused variable’ warning must be of *type* **style-warning**. 

In general, the question of whether *code* is faulty or substandard is a subjective decision to be made by the facility processing that *code*. The intent is that whenever such a facility wishes to complain about *code* on such subjective grounds, it should use this *condition type* so that any 

clients who wish to redirect or muffle superfluous warnings can do so without risking that they will be redirecting or muffling other, more serious warnings. 

**serious-condition** *Condition Type* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**serious-condition**, **condition**, **t** 

**Description:** 

All *conditions* serious enough to require interactive intervention if not handled should inherit from the *type* **serious-condition**. This condition type is provided primarily so that it may be included as a *superclass* of other *condition types*; it is not intended to be signaled directly. 

**Notes:** 

Signaling a *serious condition* does not itself force entry into the debugger. However, except in the unusual situation where the programmer can assure that no harm will come from failing to *handle* 



 

 

a *serious condition*, such a *condition* is usually signaled with **error** rather than **signal** in order to assure that the program does not continue without *handling* the *condition*. (And conversely, it is conventional to use **signal** rather than **error** to signal conditions which are not *serious conditions*, since normally the failure to handle a non-serious condition is not reason enough for the debugger to be entered.) 

**error** *Condition Type* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**error**, **serious-condition**, **condition**, **t** 

**Description:** 

The *type* **error** consists of all *conditions* that represent *errors*. 

**cell-error** *Condition Type* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**cell-error**, **error**, **serious-condition**, **condition**, **t** 

**Description:** 

The *type* **cell-error** consists of error conditions that occur during a location *access*. The name of the offending cell is initialized by the :name initialization argument to **make-condition**, and is *accessed* by the *function* **cell-error-name**. 

**See Also:** 

**cell-error-name** 

Conditions **9–13**

 

 

**cell-error-name** *Function* 

**Syntax:** 

**cell-error-name** *condition → name* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*condition*—a *condition* of *type* **cell-error**. 

*name*—an *object*. 

**Description:** 

Returns the *name* of the offending cell involved in the *situation* represented by *condition*. 

The nature of the result depends on the specific *type* of *condition*. For example, if the *condition* is of *type* **unbound-variable**, the result is the *name* of the *unbound variable* which was being *accessed*, if the *condition* is of *type* **undefined-function**, this is the *name* of the *undefined function* which was being *accessed*, and if the *condition* is of *type* **unbound-slot**, this is the *name* of the *slot* which was being *accessed*. 

**See Also:** 

**cell-error**, **unbound-slot**, **unbound-variable**, **undefined-function**, Section 9.1 (Condition System Concepts) 

**parse-error** *Condition Type* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**parse-error**, **error**, **serious-condition**, **condition**, **t** 

**Description:** 

The *type* **parse-error** consists of error conditions that are related to parsing. 

**See Also:** 

**parse-namestring**, **reader-error** 



 

 

**storage-condition** *Condition Type* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**storage-condition**, **serious-condition**, **condition**, **t** 

**Description:** 

The *type* **storage-condition** consists of serious conditions that relate to problems with memory management that are potentially due to *implementation-dependent* limits rather than semantic errors in *conforming programs*, and that typically warrant entry to the debugger if not handled. 

Depending on the details of the *implementation*, these might include such problems as stack overflow, memory region overflow, and storage exhausted. 

**Notes:** 

While some Common Lisp operations might signal *storage-condition* because they are defined to create *objects*, it is unspecified whether operations that are not defined to create *objects* create them anyway and so might also signal **storage-condition**. Likewise, the evaluator itself might create *objects* and so might signal **storage-condition**. (The natural assumption might be that such *object* creation is naturally inefficient, but even that is *implementation-dependent*.) In general, the entire question of how storage allocation is done is *implementation-dependent*, and so any operation might signal **storage-condition** at any time. Because such a *condition* is indicative of a limitation of the *implementation* or of the *image* rather than an error in a *program*, *objects* of *type* **storage-condition** are not of *type* **error**. 

**assert** *Macro* 

**Syntax:** 

**assert** *test-form* [(*&#123;place&#125;*\*) [*datum-form &#123;argument-form&#125;*\*]] 

*→* **nil** 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*test-form*—a *form*; always evaluated. 

*place*—a *place*; evaluated if an error is signaled. 

*datum-form*—a *form* that evaluates to a *datum*. Evaluated each time an error is to be signaled, or not at all if no error is to be signaled. 

*argument-form*—a *form* that evaluates to an *argument*. Evaluated each time an error is to be signaled, or not at all if no error is to be signaled. 

*datum*, *arguments*—*designators* for a *condition* of default type **error**. (These *designators* are the result of evaluating *datum-form* and each of the *argument-forms*.) 

Conditions **9–15**

 

 

**assert** 

**Description:** 

**assert** assures that *test-form* evaluates to *true*. If *test-form* evaluates to *false*, **assert** signals a *correctable error* (denoted by *datum* and *arguments*). Continuing from this error using the **continue** *restart* makes it possible for the user to alter the values of the *places* before **assert** evaluates *test-form* again. If the value of *test-form* is *non-nil*, **assert** returns **nil**. 

The *places* are *generalized references* to data upon which *test-form* depends, whose values can be changed by the user in attempting to correct the error. *Subforms* of each *place* are only evaluated if an error is signaled, and might be re-evaluated if the error is re-signaled (after continuing without actually fixing the problem). The order of evaluation of the *places* is not specified; see Section 5.1.1.1 (Evaluation of Subforms to Places). If a *place form* is supplied that produces more values than there are store variables, the extra values are ignored. If the supplied *form* produces fewer values than there are store variables, the missing values are set to **nil**. 

**Examples:** 

(setq x (make-array ’(3 5) :initial-element 3)) 

*→* #2A((3 3 3 3 3) (3 3 3 3 3) (3 3 3 3 3)) 

(setq y (make-array ’(3 5) :initial-element 7)) 

*→* #2A((7 7 7 7 7) (7 7 7 7 7) (7 7 7 7 7)) 

(defun matrix-multiply (a b) 

(let ((\*print-array\* nil)) 

(assert (and (= (array-rank a) (array-rank b) 2)

(a b) 

"Cannot multiply ~S by ~S." a b) 

(really-matrix-multiply a b))) *→* MATRIX-MULTIPLY 

(matrix-multiply x y) 

&#9655; Correctable error in MATRIX-MULTIPLY: 

&#9655; Cannot multiply #&#60;ARRAY ...&#62; by #&#60;ARRAY ...&#62;.

**\*break-on-signals\*** 

The set of active *condition handlers*. 

**See Also:** 

**check-type**, **error**, Section 5.1 (Generalized Reference) 

**Notes:** 

The debugger need not include the *test-form* in the error message, and the *places* should not be included in the message, but they should be made available for the user’s perusal. If the user gives the “continue” command, the values of any of the references can be altered. The details of this depend on the implementation’s style of user interface. 

**error** *Function* 

**Syntax:** 

**error** *datum* &rest *arguments →* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*datum*, *arguments*—*designators* for a *condition* of default type **simple-error**. 

**Description:** 

**error** effectively invokes **signal** on the denoted *condition*. 

If the *condition* is not handled, (invoke-debugger *condition*) is done. As a consequence of calling **invoke-debugger**, **error** cannot directly return; the only exit from **error** can come by non-local transfer of control in a handler or by use of an interactive debugging command. 

**Examples:** 

(defun factorial (x) 

(cond ((or (not (typep x ’integer)) (minusp x)) 

(error "~S is not a valid argument to FACTORIAL." x)) 

((zerop x) 1)

(factorial 20) 

*→* 2432902008176640000

&#9655; Error: -1 is not a valid argument to FACTORIAL.

**Side Effects:** 

*Handlers* for the specified condition, if any, are invoked and might have side effects. Program execution might stop, and the debugger might be entered. 

**Affected By:** 

Existing handler bindings. 

**\*break-on-signals\*** 

Signals an error of *type* **type-error** if *datum* and *arguments* are not *designators* for a *condition*. 

**See Also:** 

**cerror**, **signal**, **format**, **ignore-errors**, **\*break-on-signals\***, **handler-bind**, Section 9.1 (Condition 

 

 

System Concepts) 

**Notes:** 

Some implementations may provide debugger commands for interactively returning from individual stack frames. However, it should be possible for the programmer to feel confident about writing code like: 

(defun wargames:no-win-scenario () 

(if (error "pushing the button would be stupid.")) 

(push-the-button)) 

In this scenario, there should be no chance that **error** will return and the button will get pushed. 

While the meaning of this program is clear and it might be proven ‘safe’ by a formal theorem prover, such a proof is no guarantee that the program is safe to execute. Compilers have been known to have bugs, computers to have signal glitches, and human beings to manually intervene in ways that are not always possible to predict. Those kinds of errors, while beyond the scope of the condition system to formally model, are not beyond the scope of things that should seriously be considered when writing code that could have the kinds of sweeping effects hinted at by this example. 

**cerror** *Function* 

**Syntax:** 

**cerror** *continue-format-control datum* &rest *arguments →* **nil** 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*Continue-format-control*—a *format control*. 

*datum*, *arguments*—*designators* for a *condition* of default type **simple-error**. 

**Description:** 

**cerror** effectively invokes **error** on the *condition* named by *datum*. As with any function that implicitly calls **error**, if the *condition* is not handled, (invoke-debugger *condition*) is executed. While signaling is going on, and while in the debugger if it is reached, it is possible to continue code execution (*i.e.*, to return from **cerror**) using the **continue** *restart*. 

If *datum* is a *condition*, *arguments* can be supplied, but are used only in conjunction with the *continue-format-control*. 

**Examples:** 

(defun real-sqrt (n) 

(when (minusp n) 

(setq n (- n)) 

Conditions **9–19**

**error**, **format**, **handler-bind**, **\*break-on-signals\***, **simple-type-error** 

**Notes:** 

If *datum* is a *condition type* rather than a *string*, the **format** directive ~\* may be especially useful in the *continue-format-control* in order to ignore the *keywords* in the *initialization argument list*. For example: 

(cerror "enter a new value to replace ~\*~s" 

’not-a-number

**check-type** *Macro* 

**Syntax:** 

**check-type** *place typespec* [*string*] *→* **nil** 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*place*—a *place*. 

*typespec*—a *type specifier* . 

*string*—a *string*; evaluated. 



 

 

**check-type** 

**Description:** 

**check-type** signals a *correctable error* of *type* **type-error** if the contents of *place* are not of the type *typespec*. 

**check-type** can return only if the **store-value** *restart* is invoked, either explicitly from a handler or implicitly as one of the options offered by the debugger. If the **store-value** *restart* is invoked, **check-type** stores the new value that is the argument to the *restart* invocation (or that is prompted for interactively by the debugger) in *place* and starts over, checking the type of the new value and signaling another error if it is still not of the desired *type*. 

The first time *place* is *evaluated*, it is *evaluated* by normal evaluation rules. It is later *evaluated* as a *place* if the type check fails and the **store-value** *restart* is used; see Section 5.1.1.1 (Evaluation of Subforms to Places). 

*string* should be an English description of the type, starting with an indefinite article (“a” or “an”). If *string* is not supplied, it is computed automatically from *typespec*. The automatically generated message mentions *place*, its contents, and the desired type. An implementation may choose to generate a somewhat differently worded error message if it recognizes that *place* is of a particular form, such as one of the arguments to the function that called **check-type**. *string* is allowed because some applications of **check-type** may require a more specific description of what is wanted than can be generated automatically from *typespec*.

**simple-error** *Condition Type* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**simple-error**, **simple-condition**, **error**, **serious-condition**, **condition**, **t** 

**Description:** 

The *type* **simple-error** consists of *conditions* that are signaled by **error** or **cerror** when a *format control* is supplied as the function’s first argument. 

**invalid-method-error** *Function* 

**Syntax:** 

**invalid-method-error** *method format-control* &rest *args → implementation-dependent* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*method*—a *method*. 

*format-control*—a *format control*. 

*args*—*format arguments* for the *format-control*. 

**Description:** 

The *function* **invalid-method-error** is used to signal an error of *type* **error** when there is an applicable *method* whose *qualifiers* are not valid for the method combination type. The error message is constructed by using the *format-control* suitable for **format** and any *args* to it. Because an implementation may need to add additional contextual information to the error message, **invalid-method-error** should be called only within the dynamic extent of a method combination function. 

The *function* **invalid-method-error** is called automatically when a *method* fails to satisfy every *qualifier* pattern and predicate in a **define-method-combination** *form*. A method combination function that imposes additional restrictions should call **invalid-method-error** explicitly if it encounters a *method* it cannot accept. 

Whether **invalid-method-error** returns to its caller or exits via **throw** is *implementation-dependent*. Conditions **9–25**

**simple-condition** *Condition Type* 

**Class Precedence List:** 

**simple-condition**, **condition**, **t** 

**Description:** 

The *type* **simple-condition** represents *conditions* that are signaled by **signal** whenever a *format control* is supplied as the function’s first argument. The *format control* and *format arguments* are initialized with the initialization arguments named :format-control and :format-arguments to **make-condition**, and are *accessed* by the *functions* **simple-condition-format-control** and **simple-condition-format-arguments**. If format arguments are not supplied to **make-condition**, **nil** is used as a default.

**Syntax:** 

**simple-condition-format-control** *condition → format-control* 

**simple-condition-format-arguments** *condition → format-arguments* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*condition*—a *condition* of *type* **simple-condition**. 

*format-control*—a *format control*. 

*format-arguments*—a *list*. 

**Description:** 

**simple-condition-format-control** returns the *format control* needed to process the *condition*’s *format arguments*. 

**simple-condition-format-arguments** returns a *list* of *format arguments* needed to process the *condition*’s *format control*. 

**Examples:** 

(setq foo (make-condition ’simple-condition 

:format-control "Hi ~S" 

:format-arguments ’(ho))) 

*→* #&#60;SIMPLE-CONDITION 26223553&#62;

**warn** *Function* 

**Syntax:** 

**warn** *datum* &rest *arguments →* **nil** 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*datum*, *arguments*—*designators* for a *condition* of default type **simple-warning**. 

Conditions **9–29**

 

 

**warn** 

**Description:** 

*Signals* a *condition* of *type* **warning**. If the *condition* is not *handled*, reports the *condition* to *error output*. 

The precise mechanism for warning is as follows: 

**The warning condition is signaled** 

While the **warning** *condition* is being signaled, the **muffle-warning** *restart* is established for use by a *handler* . If invoked, this *restart* bypasses further action by **warn**, which in turn causes **warn** to immediately return **nil**. 

**If no handler for the warning condition is found** 

If no handlers for the warning condition are found, or if all such handlers decline, then the *condition* is reported to *error output* by **warn** in an *implementation-dependent* format. 

**nil is returned** 

The value returned by **warn** if it returns is **nil**. 

**Examples:** 

(defun foo (x) 

(let ((result (\* x 2))) 

(if (not (typep result ’fixnum)) 

(warn "You’re using very big numbers.")) 

result))

**Affected By:** 

Existing handler bindings. 

**\*break-on-signals\***, **\*error-output\***. 

**Exceptional Situations:** 

If *datum* is a *condition* and if the *condition* is not of *type* **warning**, or *arguments* is *non-nil*, an error of *type* **type-error** is signaled. 

If *datum* is a condition type, the result of (apply #’make-condition datum arguments) must be of *type* **warning** or an error of *type* **type-error** is signaled.

Conditions **9–31**

 

 

**invoke-debugger** *Function* 

**Syntax:** 

**invoke-debugger** *condition →* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*condition*—a *condition object*. 

**Description:** 

**invoke-debugger** attempts to enter the debugger with *condition*. 

If **\*debugger-hook\*** is not **nil**, it should be a *function* (or the name of a *function*) to be called prior to entry to the standard debugger. The *function* is called with **\*debugger-hook\*** bound to **nil**, and the *function* must accept two arguments: the *condition* and the *value* of **\*debugger-hook\*** prior to binding it to **nil**. If the *function* returns normally, the standard debugger is entered. 

The standard debugger never directly returns. Return can occur only by a non-local transfer of control, such as the use of a restart function. 

**Examples:** 

(ignore-errors ;Normally, this would suppress debugger entry 

(handler-bind ((error #’invoke-debugger)) ;But this forces debugger entry 

(error "Foo."))) 

Debug: Foo. 

To continue, type :CONTINUE followed by an option number: 

1: Return to Lisp Toplevel. 

Debug&#62; 

**Side Effects:** 

**\*debugger-hook\*** is bound to **nil**, program execution is discontinued, and the debugger is entered.

**See Also:** 

**error**, **break** 



 

 

**break** 

**break** *Function* 

**Syntax:** 

**break** &optional *format-control* &rest *format-arguments →* **nil** 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*format-control*—a *format control*. The default is *implementation-dependent*. 

*format-arguments*—*format arguments* for the *format-control*. 

**Description:** 

**break** *formats format-control* and *format-arguments* and then goes directly into the debugger without allowing any possibility of interception by programmed error-handling facilities. 

If the **continue** *restart* is used while in the debugger, **break** immediately returns **nil** without taking any unusual recovery action. 

**break** binds **\*debugger-hook\*** to **nil** before attempting to enter the debugger. 

**Examples:** 

(break "You got here with arguments: ~:S." ’(FOO 37 A)) 

&#9655; BREAK: You got here with these arguments: FOO, 37, A. 

&#9655; To continue, type :CONTINUE followed by an option number: 

&#9655; 1: Return from BREAK. 

&#9655; 2: Top level. 

&#9655; Debug&#62; :CONTINUE 1 

&#9655; Return from BREAK. 

*→* NIL 

**Side Effects:** 

The debugger is entered. 

**Affected By:** 

**\*debug-io\***. 

**See Also:** 

**error**, **invoke-debugger**. 

**Notes:** 

**break** is used as a way of inserting temporary debugging “breakpoints” in a program, not as a way of signaling errors. For this reason, **break** does not take the *continue-format-control argument* that **cerror** takes. This and the lack of any possibility of interception by *condition handling* are the only program-visible differences between **break** and **cerror**. 

Conditions **9–33**

 

 

The user interface aspects of **break** and **cerror** are permitted to vary more widely, in order to accomodate the interface needs of the *implementation*. For example, it is permissible for a *Lisp read-eval-print loop* to be entered by **break** rather than the conventional debugger. 

**break** could be defined by: 

(defun break (&optional (format-control "Break") &rest format-arguments) 

(with-simple-restart (continue "Return from BREAK.") 

(let ((\*debugger-hook\* nil)) 

(invoke-debugger 

(make-condition ’simple-condition 

:format-control format-control 

:format-arguments format-arguments)))) 

nil) 

*∗***debugger-hook***∗ Variable* 

**Value Type:** 

a *designator* for a *function* of two *arguments* (a *condition* and the *value* of **\*debugger-hook\*** at the time the debugger was entered), or **nil**. 

**Initial Value:** 

**nil**. 

**Description:** 

When the *value* of **\*debugger-hook\*** is *non-nil*, it is called prior to normal entry into the debugger, either due to a call to **invoke-debugger** or due to automatic entry into the debugger from a call to **error** or **cerror** with a condition that is not handled. The *function* may either handle the *condition* (transfer control) or return normally (allowing the standard debugger to run). To minimize recursive errors while debugging, **\*debugger-hook\*** is bound to **nil** by **invoke-debugger** prior to calling the *function*. 

**Examples:** 

(defun one-of (choices &optional (prompt "Choice")) 

(let ((n (length choices)) (i)) 

(do ((c choices (cdr c)) (i 1 (+ i 1))) 

((null c)) 

(format t "~&[~D] ~A~%" i (car c))) 

(do () ((typep i ‘(integer 1 ,n))) 

(format t "~&~A: " prompt) 

(setq i (read)) 



 

 

(fresh-line)) 

(nth (- i 1) choices))) 

(defun my-debugger (condition me-or-my-encapsulation) 

(format t "~&Fooey: ~A" condition) 

(let ((restart (one-of (compute-restarts)))) 

(if (not restart) (error "My debugger got an error.")) 

(let ((\*debugger-hook\* me-or-my-encapsulation)) 

(invoke-restart-interactively restart))))

&#9655; Form to evaluate and use: (+ 5 ’b) 

&#9655; Fooey: The argument to +, B, is not a number. 

&#9655; [1] Supply a replacement for B. 

&#9655; [2] Supply a replacement for A. 

&#9655; [3] Return to Cloe Toplevel. 

&#9655; Choice: 1 

&#9655; Form to evaluate and use: 1 

*→* 9 

**Affected By:** 

**invoke-debugger** 

**Notes:** 

When evaluating code typed in by the user interactively, it is sometimes useful to have the hook function bind **\*debugger-hook\*** to the *function* that was its second argument so that recursive errors can be handled using the same interactive facility. 

*∗***break-on-signals***∗ Variable* 

**Value Type:** 

a *type specifier* . 

**Initial Value:**

Conditions **9–35**

 

 

*∗***break-on-signals***∗* 

**Description:** 

When (typep *condition* \*break-on-signals\*) returns *true*, calls to **signal**, and to other *operators* such as **error** that implicitly call **signal**, enter the debugger prior to *signaling* the *condition*. 

The **continue** *restart* can be used to continue with the normal *signaling* process when a break occurs process due to **\*break-on-signals\***. 

**Examples:**

**See Also:** 

**break**, **signal**, **warn**, **error**, **typep**, Section 9.1 (Condition System Concepts) 

**Notes:** 

**\*break-on-signals\*** is intended primarily for use in debugging code that does signaling. When setting **\*break-on-signals\***, the user is encouraged to choose the most restrictive specification 



 

 

that suffices. Setting **\*break-on-signals\*** effectively violates the modular handling of *condition* signaling. In practice, the complete effect of setting **\*break-on-signals\*** might be unpredictable in some cases since the user might not be aware of the variety or number of calls to **signal** that are used in code called only incidentally. 

**\*break-on-signals\*** enables an early entry to the debugger but such an entry does not preclude an additional entry to the debugger in the case of operations such as **error** and **cerror**. 

**handler-bind** *Macro* 

**Syntax:** 

**handler-bind** (*&#123;↓binding&#125;*\*) *&#123;form&#125;*\* *→ &#123;result&#125;*\* 

*binding::*=(*type handler*) 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*type*—a *type specifier* . 

*handler*—a *form*; evaluated to produce a *handler-function*. 

*handler-function*—a *designator* for a *function* of one *argument*. 

*forms*—an *implicit progn*. 

*results*—the *values* returned by the *forms*. 

**Description:** 

Executes *forms* in a *dynamic environment* where the indicated *handler bindings* are in effect. 

Each *handler* should evaluate to a *handler-function*, which is used to handle *conditions* of the given *type* during execution of the *forms*. This *function* should take a single argument, the *condition* being signaled. 

If more than one *handler binding* is supplied, the *handler bindings* are searched sequentially from top to bottom in search of a match (by visual analogy with **typecase**). If an appropriate *type* is found, the associated handler is run in a *dynamic environment* where none of these *handler* bindings are visible (to avoid recursive errors). If the *handler declines*, the search continues for another *handler* . 

If no appropriate *handler* is found, other *handlers* are sought from dynamically enclosing contours. If no *handler* is found outside, then **signal** returns or **error** enters the debugger. 

**Examples:** 

In the following code, if an unbound variable error is signaled in the body (and not handled by an intervening handler), the first function is called. 

Conditions **9–37**

 

 

(handler-bind ((unbound-variable #’(lambda ...)) 

(error #’(lambda ...))) 

...) 

If any other kind of error is signaled, the second function is called. In either case, neither handler is active while executing the code in the associated function. 

(defun trap-error-handler (condition) 

(format \*error-output\* "~&~A~&" condition) 

(throw ’trap-errors nil)) 

(defmacro trap-errors (&rest forms) 

‘(catch ’trap-errors 

(handler-bind ((error #’trap-error-handler)) 

,@forms))) 

(list (trap-errors (signal "Foo.") 1) 

(trap-errors (error "Bar.") 2) 

(+ 1 2)) 

&#9655; Bar. 

*→* (1 NIL 3) 

Note that “Foo.” is not printed because the condition made by **signal** is a *simple condition*, which is not of *type* **error**, so it doesn’t trigger the handler for **error** set up by trap-errors.

**handler-case** 

**handler-case** *Macro* 

**Syntax:** 

**handler-case** *expression* [[ *&#123;↓error-clause&#125;*\* *| ↓no-error-clause* ]] *→ &#123;result&#125;*\*

*no-error-clause::*=(:no-error *lambda-list &#123;declaration&#125;*\* *&#123;form&#125;*\*) 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*expression*—a *form*. 

*typespec*—a *type specifier* . 



 

 

**handler-case** 

*var*—a *variable name*. 

*lambda-list*—an *ordinary lambda list*. 

*declaration*—a **declare** *expression*; not evaluated. 

*form*—a *form*. 

*results*—In the normal situation, the values returned are those that result from the evaluation of *expression*; in the exceptional situation when control is transferred to a *clause*, the value of the last *form* in that *clause* is returned. 

**Description:** 

**handler-case** executes *expression* in a *dynamic environment* where various handlers are active. Each *error-clause* specifies how to handle a *condition* matching the indicated *typespec*. A *no-error-clause* allows the specification of a particular action if control returns normally. 

If a *condition* is signaled for which there is an appropriate *error-clause* during the execution of *expression* (*i.e.*, one for which (typep *condition* ’*typespec*) returns *true*) and if there is no intervening handler for a *condition* of that *type*, then control is transferred to the body of the relevant *error-clause*. In this case, the dynamic state is unwound appropriately (so that the handlers established around the *expression* are no longer active), and *var* is bound to the *condition* that had been signaled. If more than one case is provided, those cases are made accessible in parallel. That is, in 

(handler-case *form* 

(*typespec1* (*var1*) *form1*) 

(*typespec2* (*var2*) *form2*)) 

if the first *clause* (containing *form1*) has been selected, the handler for the second is no longer visible (or vice versa). 

The *clauses* are searched sequentially from top to bottom. If there is *type* overlap between *typespecs*, the earlier of the *clauses* is selected. 

If *var* is not needed, it can be omitted. That is, a *clause* such as: 

(*typespec* (*var*) (declare (ignore *var*)) *form*) 

can be written (*typespec* () *form*). 

If there are no *forms* in a selected *clause*, the case, and therefore **handler-case**, returns **nil**. If execution of *expression* returns normally and no *no-error-clause* exists, the values returned by *expression* are returned by **handler-case**. If execution of *expression* returns normally and a *no-error-clause* does exist, the values returned are used as arguments to the function described by constructing (lambda *lambda-list &#123;form&#125;*\*) from the *no-error-clause*, and the *values* of that function call are returned by **handler-case**. The handlers which were established around the *expression* are no longer active at the time of this call.

**ignore-errors** *Macro* 

**Syntax:** 

**ignore-errors** *&#123;form&#125;*\* *→ &#123;result&#125;*\* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*forms*—an *implicit progn*. 

*results*—In the normal situation, the *values* of the *forms* are returned; in the exceptional situation, two values are returned: **nil** and the *condition*. 

**Description:** 

**ignore-errors** is used to prevent *conditions* of *type* **error** from causing entry into the debugger. 

Specifically, **ignore-errors** *executes forms* in a *dynamic environment* where a *handler* for *conditions* of *type* **error** has been established; if invoked, it *handles* such *conditions* by returning two *values*, **nil** and the *condition* that was *signaled*, from the **ignore-errors** *form*. 

If a *normal return* from the *forms* occurs, any *values* returned are returned by **ignore-errors**. **Examples:** 

(defun load-init-file (program) 

(let ((win nil)) 

(ignore-errors ;if this fails, don’t enter debugger 

(load (merge-pathnames (make-pathname :name program :type :lisp) 

(user-homedir-pathname))) 

(setq win t)) 

(unless win (format t "~&Init file failed to load.~%")) 

win)) 

Conditions **9–41**

(ignore-errors . *forms*) 

is equivalent to:

(error (condition) (values nil condition))) 

Because the second return value is a *condition* in the exceptional case, it is common (but not required) to arrange for the second return value in the normal case to be missing or **nil** so that the two situations can be distinguished.

:initarg 

:initarg can be supplied more than once for a given *slot*. 

:initform 

:initform can be supplied once at most for a given *slot*. 

:type 

:type can be supplied once at most for a given *slot*. 

Conditions **9–43**

 

 

**define-condition** 

:documentation 

:documentation can be supplied once at most for a given *slot*. 

:report 

:report can be supplied once at most. 

**Description:** 

**define-condition** defines a new condition type called *name*, which is a *subtype* of the *type* or *types* named by *parent-type*. Each *parent-type* argument specifies a direct *supertype* of the new *condition*. The new *condition* inherits *slots* and *methods* from each of its direct *supertypes*, and so on. 

If a slot name/slot form pair is supplied, the slot form is a *form* that can be evaluated by **make-condition** to produce a default value when an explicit value is not provided. If no slot form is supplied, the contents of the *slot* is initialized in an *implementation-dependent* way. 

If the *type* being defined and some other *type* from which it inherits have a slot by the same name, only one slot is allocated in the *condition*, but the supplied slot form overrides any slot form that might otherwise have been inherited from a *parent-type*. If no slot form is supplied, the inherited slot form (if any) is still visible. 

Accessors are created according to the same rules as used by **defclass**. 

A description of *slot-options* follows: 

:reader 

The :reader slot option specifies that an *unqualified method* is to be defined on the *generic function* named by the argument to :reader to read the value of the given *slot*. 

*•* The :initform slot option is used to provide a default initial value form to be used in the initialization of the *slot*. This *form* is evaluated every time it is used to initialize the *slot*. The *lexical environment* in which this *form* is evaluated is the lexical *environment* in which the **define-condition** form was evaluated. Note that the *lexical environment* refers both to variables and to *functions*. For *local slots*, the *dynamic environment* is the dynamic *environment* in which **make-condition** was called; for *shared slots*, the *dynamic environment* is the *dynamic environment* in which the **define-condition** form was evaluated. 

No implementation is permitted to extend the syntax of **define-condition** to allow (*slot-name form*) as an abbreviation for (*slot-name* :initform *form*). 

:initarg 

The :initarg slot option declares an initialization argument named by its *symbol* argument and specifies that this initialization argument initializes the given *slot*. If the initialization 



 

 

**define-condition** 

argument has a value in the call to **initialize-instance**, the value is stored into the given *slot*, and the slot’s :initform slot option, if any, is not evaluated. If none of the initialization arguments specified for a given *slot* has a value, the *slot* is initialized according to the :initform slot option, if specified. 

:type 

The :type slot option specifies that the contents of the *slot* is always of the specified *type*. It effectively declares the result type of the reader generic function when applied to an *object* of this *condition* type. The consequences of attempting to store in a *slot* a value that does not satisfy the type of the *slot* is undefined. 

:default-initargs 

This option is treated the same as it would be **defclass**. 

:documentation 

The :documentation slot option provides a *documentation string* for the *slot*. 

:report 

*Condition* reporting is mediated through the **print-object** method for the *condition* type in question, with **\*print-escape\*** always being **nil**. Specifying (:report *report-name*) in the definition of a condition type C is equivalent to: 

(defmethod print-object ((x c) stream) 

(if \*print-escape\* (call-next-method) (*report-name* x stream))) 

If the value supplied by the argument to :report (*report-name*) is a *symbol* or a *lambda expression*, it must be acceptable to **function**. (function *report-name*) is evaluated in the current *lexical environment*. It should return a *function* of two arguments, a *condition* and a *stream*, that prints on the *stream* a description of the *condition*. This *function* is called whenever the *condition* is printed while **\*print-escape\*** is **nil**. 

If *report-name* is a *string*, it is a shorthand for 

(lambda (condition stream) 

(declare (ignore condition)) 

(write-string *report-name* stream)) 

This option is processed after the new *condition* type has been defined, so use of the *slot* accessors within the :report function is permitted. If this option is not supplied, information about how to report this type of *condition* is inherited from the *parent-type*. 

The consequences are unspecifed if an attempt is made to *read* a *slot* that has not been explicitly initialized and that has not been given a default value. 

The consequences are unspecified if an attempt is made to assign the *slots* by using **setf**. Conditions **9–45**

 

 

**define-condition** 

If a **define-condition** *form* appears as a *top level form*, the *compiler* must make *name* recognizable as a valid *type* name, and it must be possible to reference the *condition type* as the *parent-type* of another *condition type* in a subsequent **define-condition** *form* in the *file* being compiled. 

**Examples:** 

The following form defines a condition of *type* peg/hole-mismatch which inherits from a condition type called blocks-world-error: 

(define-condition peg/hole-mismatch 

(blocks-world-error) 

((peg-shape :initarg :peg-shape 

:reader peg/hole-mismatch-peg-shape) 

(hole-shape :initarg :hole-shape 

:reader peg/hole-mismatch-hole-shape)) 

(:report (lambda (condition stream) 

(format stream "A ~A peg cannot go in a ~A hole." 

(peg/hole-mismatch-peg-shape condition) 

(peg/hole-mismatch-hole-shape condition))))) 

The new type has slots peg-shape and hole-shape, so **make-condition** accepts :peg-shape and :hole-shape keywords. The *readers* peg/hole-mismatch-peg-shape and peg/hole-mismatch-hole-shape apply to objects of this type, as illustrated in the :report information. 

The following form defines a *condition type* named machine-error which inherits from **error**: 

(define-condition machine-error 

(error) 

((machine-name :initarg :machine-name 

:reader machine-error-machine-name)) 

(:report (lambda (condition stream) 

(format stream "There is a problem with ~A." 

(machine-error-machine-name condition))))) 

Building on this definition, a new error condition can be defined which is a subtype of machine-error for use when machines are not available: 

(define-condition machine-not-available-error (machine-error) () 

(:report (lambda (condition stream) 

(format stream "The machine ~A is not available." 

(machine-error-machine-name condition))))) 

This defines a still more specific condition, built upon machine-not-available-error, which provides a slot initialization form for machine-name but which does not provide any new slots or report information. It just gives the machine-name slot a default initialization: 

(define-condition my-favorite-machine-not-available-error 

(machine-not-available-error) 



 

 

((machine-name :initform "mc.lcs.mit.edu"))) 

Note that since no :report clause was given, the information inherited from machine-not-available-error is used to report this type of condition. 

(define-condition ate-too-much (error) 

((person :initarg :person :reader ate-too-much-person) 

(weight :initarg :weight :reader ate-too-much-weight)

(:report (lambda (condition stream)

**compute-restarts** &optional *condition → restarts* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*condition*—a *condition object*, or **nil**. 

*restarts*—a *list* of *restarts*. 

**Description:** 

**compute-restarts** uses the dynamic state of the program to compute a *list* of the *restarts* which are currently active. 

The resulting *list* is ordered so that the innermost (more-recently established) restarts are nearer the head of the *list*. 

When *condition* is *non-nil*, only those *restarts* are considered that are either explicitly associated with that *condition*, or not associated with any *condition*; that is, the excluded *restarts* are those that are associated with a non-empty set of *conditions* of which the given *condition* is not an *element*. If *condition* is **nil**, all *restarts* are considered. 

**compute-restarts** returns all *applicable restarts*, including anonymous ones, even if some of them have the same name as others and would therefore not be found by **find-restart** when given a *symbol* argument. 

Implementations are permitted, but not required, to return *distinct lists* from repeated calls to **compute-restarts** while in the same dynamic environment. The consequences are undefined if the *list* returned by **compute-restarts** is every modified.

*restart*—a *restart* or **nil**. 

**Description:** 

**find-restart** searches for a particular *restart* in the current *dynamic environment*. 

 

 

When *condition* is *non-nil*, only those *restarts* are considered that are either explicitly associated with that *condition*, or not associated with any *condition*; that is, the excluded *restarts* are those that are associated with a non-empty set of *conditions* of which the given *condition* is not an *element*. If *condition* is **nil**, all *restarts* are considered. 

If *identifier* is a *symbol*, then the innermost (most recently established) *applicable restart* with that *name* is returned. **nil** is returned if no such restart is found. 

If *identifier* is a currently active restart, then it is returned. Otherwise, **nil** is returned. **Examples:**

**Description:**

*restart*—a *restart designator* . 

*results*—the *values* returned by the *function* associated with *restart*, if that *function* returns. 

**Description:** 

**invoke-restart-interactively** calls the *function* associated with *restart*, prompting for any necessary arguments. If *restart* is a name, it must be valid in the current *dynamic environment*. 

**invoke-restart-interactively** prompts for arguments by executing the code provided in the :interactive keyword to **restart-case** or :interactive-function keyword to **restart-bind**. 

If no such options have been supplied in the corresponding **restart-bind** or **restart-case**, then the consequences are undefined if the *restart* takes required arguments. If the arguments are optional, an argument list of **nil** is used. 

Once the arguments have been determined, **invoke-restart-interactively** executes the following: (apply #’invoke-restart *restart arguments*) 

**Examples:** 

(defun add3 (x) (check-type x number) (+ x 3)) 

(add3 ’seven) 

&#9655; Error: The value SEVEN was not of type NUMBER. 

&#9655; To continue, type :CONTINUE followed by an option number: 

&#9655; 1: Specify a different value to use. 

&#9655; 2: Return to Lisp Toplevel. 

&#9655; Debug&#62; (invoke-restart-interactively ’store-value) 

&#9655; Type a form to evaluate and use: 7 

*→* 10 

**Side Effects:** 

If prompting for arguments is necesary, some typeout may occur (on *query I/O*). 

A non-local transfer of control might be done by the restart. 

**Affected By:** 

**\*query-io\***, active *restarts* 

Conditions **9–53**

 

 

**Exceptional Situations:** 

If *restart* is not valid, an error of *type* **control-error** is signaled. 

**See Also:** 

**find-restart**, **invoke-restart**, **restart-case**, **restart-bind** 

**Notes:** 

**invoke-restart-interactively** is used internally by the debugger and may also be useful in implementing other portable, interactive debugging tools. 

**restart-bind** *Macro* 

**Syntax:** 

**restart-bind** (*&#123;*(*name function &#123;↓key-val-pair&#125;*\*)*&#125;*) *&#123;form&#125;*\* 

*→ &#123;result&#125;*\* 

*key-val-pair::*=:interactive-function *interactive-function |* 

:report-function *report-function |* 

:test-function *test-function* 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*name*—a *symbol*; not evaluated. 

*function*—a *form*; evaluated. 

*forms*—an *implicit progn*. 

*interactive-function*—a *form*; evaluated. 

*report-function*—a *form*; evaluated. 

*test-function*—a *form*; evaluated. 

*results*—the *values* returned by the *forms*. 

**Description:** 

**restart-bind** executes the body of *forms* in a *dynamic environment* where *restarts* with the given *names* are in effect. 

If a *name* is **nil**, it indicates an anonymous restart; if a *name* is a *non-nil symbol*, it indicates a named restart. 



 

 

**restart-bind** 

The *function*, *interactive-function*, and *report-function* are unconditionally evaluated in the current lexical and dynamic environment prior to evaluation of the body. Each of these *forms* must evaluate to a *function*. 

If **invoke-restart** is done on that restart, the *function* which resulted from evaluating *function* is called, in the *dynamic environment* of the **invoke-restart**, with the *arguments* given to **invoke-restart**. The *function* may either perform a non-local transfer of control or may return normally. 

If the restart is invoked interactively from the debugger (using **invoke-restart-interactively**), the arguments are defaulted by calling the *function* which resulted from evaluating *interactive-function*. That *function* may optionally prompt interactively on *query I/O*, and should return a *list* of arguments to be used by **invoke-restart-interactively** when invoking the restart. 

If a restart is invoked interactively but no *interactive-function* is used, then an argument list of **nil** is used. In that case, the *function* must be compatible with an empty argument list. 

If the restart is presented interactively (*e.g.*, by the debugger), the presentation is done by calling the *function* which resulted from evaluating *report-function*. This *function* must be a *function* of one argument, a *stream*. It is expected to print a description of the action that the restart takes to that *stream*. This *function* is called any time the restart is printed while **\*print-escape\*** is **nil**. 

In the case of interactive invocation, the result is dependent on the value of :interactive-function as follows. 

:interactive-function 

*Value* is evaluated in the current lexical environment and should return a *function* of no arguments which constructs a *list* of arguments to be used by **invoke-restart-interactively** when invoking this restart. The *function* may prompt interactively using *query I/O* if necessary. 

:report-function 

*Value* is evaluated in the current lexical environment and should return a *function* of one argument, a *stream*, which prints on the *stream* a summary of the action that this restart takes. This *function* is called whenever the restart is reported (printed while **\*print-escape\*** is **nil**). If no :report-function option is provided, the manner in which the *restart* is reported is *implementation-dependent*. 

:test-function 

*Value* is evaluated in the current lexical environment and should return a *function* of one argument, a *condition*, which returns *true* if the restart is to be considered visible. 

**Affected By:** 

**\*query-io\***. 

Conditions **9–55**

 

 

**See Also:** 

**restart-case**, **with-simple-restart** 

**Notes:** 

**restart-bind** is primarily intended to be used to implement **restart-case** and might be useful in implementing other macros. Programmers who are uncertain about whether to use **restart-case** or **restart-bind** should prefer **restart-case** for the cases where it is powerful enough, using **restart-bind** only in cases where its full generality is really needed. 

**restart-case** *Macro* 

**Syntax:** 

**restart-case** *restartable-form &#123;↓clause&#125; → &#123;result&#125;*\* 

*clause::*=(*case-name lambda-list* 

[[ :interactive *interactive-expression |* :report *report-expression |* :test *test-expression* ]] *&#123;declaration&#125;*\* *&#123;form&#125;*\*) 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*restartable-form*—a *form*. 

*case-name*—a *symbol* or **nil**. 

*lambda-list*—an *ordinary lambda list*. 

*interactive-expression*—a *symbol* or a *lambda expression*. 

*report-expression*—a *string*, a *symbol*, or a *lambda expression*. 

*test-expression*—a *symbol* or a *lambda expression*. 

*declaration*—a **declare** *expression*; not evaluated. 

*form*—a *form*. 

*results*—the *values* resulting from the *evaluation* of *restartable-form*, or the *values* returned by the last *form* executed in a chosen *clause*, or **nil**. 

**Description:** 

**restart-case** evaluates *restartable-form* in a *dynamic environment* where the clauses have special meanings as points to which control may be transferred. If *restartable-form* finishes executing and returns any values, all values returned are returned by **restart-case** and processing has completed. While *restartable-form* is executing, any code may transfer control to one of the clauses (see 



 

 

**restart-case** 

**invoke-restart**). If a transfer occurs, the forms in the body of that clause is evaluated and any values returned by the last such form are returned by **restart-case**. In this case, the dynamic state is unwound appropriately (so that the restarts established around the *restartable-form* are no longer active) prior to execution of the clause. 

If there are no *forms* in a selected clause, **restart-case** returns **nil**. 

If *case-name* is a *symbol*, it names this restart. 

It is possible to have more than one clause use the same *case-name*. In this case, the first clause with that name is found by **find-restart**. The other clauses are accessible using **compute-restarts**. 

Each *arglist* is an *ordinary lambda list* to be bound during the execution of its corresponding *forms*. These parameters are used by the **restart-case** clause to receive any necessary data from a call to **invoke-restart**. 

By default, **invoke-restart-interactively** passes no arguments and all arguments must be optional in order to accomodate interactive restarting. However, the arguments need not be optional if the :interactive keyword has been used to inform **invoke-restart-interactively** about how to compute a proper argument list. 

*Keyword* options have the following meaning. 

:interactive 

The *value* supplied by :interactive *value* must be a suitable argument to **function**. (function *value*) is evaluated in the current lexical environment. It should return a *function* of no arguments which returns arguments to be used by **invoke-restart-interactively** when it is invoked. **invoke-restart-interactively** is called in the dynamic environment available prior to any restart attempt, and uses *query I/O* for user interaction. 

If a restart is invoked interactively but no :interactive option was supplied, the argument list used in the invocation is the empty list. 

:report 

If the *value* supplied by :report *value* is a *lambda expression* or a *symbol*, it must be acceptable to **function**. (function *value*) is evaluated in the current lexical environment. It should return a *function* of one argument, a *stream*, which prints on the *stream* a description of the restart. This *function* is called whenever the restart is printed while **\*print-escape\*** is **nil**. 

If *value* is a *string*, it is a shorthand for 

(lambda (stream) (write-string value stream)) 

If a named restart is asked to report but no report information has been supplied, the name of the restart is used in generating default report text. 

Conditions **9–57**

 

 

**restart-case** 

When **\*print-escape\*** is **nil**, the printer uses the report information for a restart. For example, a debugger might announce the action of typing a “continue” command by: 

(format t "~&~S – ~A~%" ’:continue some-restart) 

which might then display as something like: 

:CONTINUE – Return to command level 

The consequences are unspecified if an unnamed restart is specified but no :report option is provided. 

:test 

The *value* supplied by :test *value* must be a suitable argument to **function**. 

(function *value*) is evaluated in the current lexical environment. It should return a *function* of one *argument*, the *condition*, that returns *true* if the restart is to be considered visible. 

The default for this option is equivalent to (lambda (c) (declare (ignore c)) t). 

If the *restartable-form* is a *list* whose *car* is any of the *symbols* **signal**, **error**, **cerror**, or **warn** (or is a *macro form* which macroexpands into such a *list*), then **with-condition-restarts** is used implicitly to associate the indicated *restarts* with the *condition* to be signaled. 

**Examples:** 

(restart-case 

(handler-bind ((error #’(lambda (c) 

(declare (ignore condition)) 

(invoke-restart ’my-restart 7)))) 

(error "Foo."))

Unnamed restarts are generally only useful interactively and an interactive option which has no description is of little value. Implementations are encouraged to warn if an unnamed restart is used and no report information is provided at compilation time. At runtime, this error might be noticed when entering the debugger. Since signaling an error would probably cause recursive entry into the debugger (causing yet another recursive error, etc.) it is suggested that the debugger print some indication of such problems when they occur but not actually signal errors.

*results*—in the normal situation, the *values* returned by the *forms*; in the exceptional situation where the *restart* named *name* is invoked, two values—**nil** and **t**. 

**Description:** 

**with-simple-restart** establishes a restart. 

If the restart designated by *name* is not invoked while executing *forms*, all values returned by the last of *forms* are returned. If the restart designated by *name* is invoked, control is transferred to **with-simple-restart**, which returns two values, **nil** and **t**. 

If *name* is **nil**, an anonymous restart is established. 

The *format-control* and *format-arguments* are used report the *restart*.

Because the second return value is **t** in the exceptional case, it is common (but not required) to arrange for the second return value in the normal case to be missing or **nil** so that the two situations can be distinguished. 

**abort** *Restart* 

**Data Arguments Required:** 

None. 

**Description:** 

The intent of the **abort** restart is to allow return to the innermost “command level.” Implementors are encouraged to make sure that there is always a restart named **abort** around any user code so that user code can call **abort** at any time and expect something reasonable to happen; exactly what the reasonable thing is may vary somewhat. Typically, in an interactive listener, the invocation of 

**abort** returns to the *Lisp reader* phase of the *Lisp read-eval-print loop*, though in some batch or multi-processing situations there may be situations in which having it kill the running process is more appropriate.

**continue** *Restart* 

**Data Arguments Required:**

**Description:** 

The **continue** *restart* is generally part of protocols where there is a single “obvious” way to continue, such as in **break** and **cerror**. Some user-defined protocols may also wish to incorporate it for similar reasons. In general, however, it is more reliable to design a special purpose restart with a name that more directly suits the particular application. 

**Examples:** 

(let ((x 3)) 

(handler-bind ((error #’(lambda (c) 

(let ((r (find-restart ’continue c))) 

(when r (invoke-restart r))))))

**store-value** *Restart* 

**Data Arguments Required:** 

a value to use instead (on an ongoing basis). 

**Description:** 

The **store-value** *restart* is generally used by *handlers* trying to recover from errors of *types* such as **cell-error** or **type-error**, which may wish to supply a replacement datum to be stored permanently. 

**Examples:** 

(defun type-error-auto-coerce (c) 

(when (typep c ’type-error) 

(let ((r (find-restart ’store-value c))) 

(handler-case (let ((v (coerce (type-error-datum c)

**use-value** *Restart* 

**Data Arguments Required:** 

a value to use instead (once). 

**Description:** 

The **use-value** *restart* is generally used by *handlers* trying to recover from errors of *types* such as **cell-error**, where the handler may wish to supply a replacement datum for one-time use. 

**See Also:**

**Syntax:** 

**abort** &optional *condition →* 

**continue** &optional *condition →* **nil** 

**muffle-warning** &optional *condition →* 

**store-value** *value* &optional *condition →* **nil** 

**use-value** *value* &optional *condition →* **nil** 



 

 

**abort, continue, muffle-warning, store-value, use-value** 

**Arguments and Values:** 

*value*—an *object*. 

*condition*—a *condition object*, or **nil**. 

**Description:** 

Transfers control to the most recently established *applicable restart* having the same name as the function. That is, the *function* **abort** searches for an *applicable* **abort** *restart*, the *function* **continue** searches for an *applicable* **continue** *restart*, and so on. 

If no such *restart* exists, the functions **continue**, **store-value**, and **use-value** return **nil**, and the functions **abort** and **muffle-warning** signal an error of *type* **control-error**. 

When *condition* is *non-nil*, only those *restarts* are considered that are either explicitly associated with that *condition*, or not associated with any *condition*; that is, the excluded *restarts* are those that are associated with a non-empty set of *conditions* of which the given *condition* is not an *element*. If *condition* is **nil**, all *restarts* are considered.

**Side Effects:** 

A transfer of control may occur if an appropriate *restart* is available, or (in the case of the *function* **abort** or the *function* **muffle-warning**) execution may be stopped. 

**Affected By:** 

Each of these functions can be affected by the presence of a *restart* having the same name. Conditions **9–71**

 

 

**abort, continue, muffle-warning, store-value, use-value** 

**Exceptional Situations:** 

If an appropriate **abort** *restart* is not available for the *function* **abort**, or an appropriate **muffle-warning** *restart* is not available for the *function* **muffle-warning**, an error of *type* **control-error** is signaled.
