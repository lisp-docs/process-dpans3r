\\EV ((1 . \"one\") (2 A B C))
 (setq object-too object) \\EV ((1 . \"one\") (2 A B C))
 (setq copy-as-list (copy-list object))
 (setq copy-as-alist (copy-alist object))
 (setq copy-as-tree (copy-tree object))
 (eq object object-too) \\EV \\term{true}
 (eq copy-as-tree object) \\EV \\term{false}
 (eql copy-as-tree object) \\EV \\term{false}
 (equal copy-as-tree object) \\EV \\term{true}
 (setf (first (cdr (second object))) \"a\"
       (car (second object)) \"two\"

- make file of all code blocks turned into md, wihtout tex processing, for manual changes..
  - same as for tables, list in the file the file source
- find all tables with regex "\\displaytwo\\{[^\\}]*?\\}\\{[^\\}]*?\\}"
- again do not replace tables.. maybe just list before the file where they were found and print them to a file...
